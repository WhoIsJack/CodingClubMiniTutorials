#### From (Python) Script to (Python) Program
**Date & Time:** 12.01.2017, 17:00-17:30
**Tutor:** Jonas
**Level:** Beginner and Intermediate
**Language:** Python (though the basic considerations apply for all languages)
**Abstract:** Every now and then, we all actually manage to finish a script. Good job, us! Next, we may want to use this script on a regular basis, probably with slightly different input and parameters each time. We may also want to make the script available for others to use, quickly and easily. One very simple way of accomplishing this is to make the script into a command-line executable program. This tutorial will illustrate how this can be done with a python example.
