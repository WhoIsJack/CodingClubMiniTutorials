\n\n Figure 1: Embryonic pre-implantation development: Tracking of all cells throughout the first mitotic divisions, from zygote to blastocyst stage, using an inverted light-sheet microscope. Nuclei detected by their H2B signal are shown. Colour-coded spheres indicate cells of different fate: trophoectoderm (TE; blue) or inner cell mass (ICM; red) (Strnad P et al. 2016). The Ellenberg group studies how cells divide and organise in mitosis and meiosis, where errors can lead to problems such as cancer and infertility. Our overall goal is to systematically elucidate the mechanisms underlying cell division and nuclear organisation. We are developing a broad range of advanced fluorescence-based imaging technologies to assay the functions of the involved molecular machinery non-invasively, automate imaging to address all its molecular components, and computationally process image data to extract biochemical and biophysical parameters. Our research focuses on three areas: systems biology of mitosis, nuclear structure, and molecular mechanisms of meiosis and early embryonic mitosis. We have previously identified hundreds of new cell division genes by RNAi-based screening of the entire human genome and we are now studying \u2013 in live cells and with high-throughput \u2013 protein function, interactions and networks during somatic mitosis by automating advanced fluorescence imaging and single molecule techniques, such as fluorescence (cross) correlation spectroscopy. We also determined the positions of various nuclear pore complex (NPC) components and directly resolved the ring-like structure of the NPC, combining stochastic super-resolution microscopy (SRM) with single particle averaging. Currently, we elucidate the assembly mechanism of the NPC and chromatin dynamics over the cell cycle. By complete kinetochore tracking we demonstrated that meiotic chromosome biorientation is highly error-prone. We have now developed a gentle light-sheet-based microscope for high-throughput imaging of mouse oocytes and embryos to enable systematic molecular analysis of meiosis and early embryonic mitosis (figure 1).  We also contribute to EMBL's Bio-IT community and the internal EMBL Bio-IT web portal. This resource aims to promote networking and facilitate the work of computational biologists working throughout the EMBL community. It provides information on relevant events, computational services, and expertise on computational biology issues. \n\n Figure 2: A 3D metaphase model reconstructed from confocal images of HeLa cells. The colours identify different elements / proteins important for mitosis (centrosome, cyan; chromatin, green; kinetochores / centromeres, red). We want to gain comprehensive mechanistic insight into the division of human mitotic cells, provide a biophysical basis to understand nuclear organisation, and establish methods for systems analysis of the meiotic and first mitotic divisions of mammalian oocytes and embryos. For a systems-level understanding of all crucial protein interactions during cell division, we will combine automated bulk, single molecule imaging and computational data analysis with advanced machine learning and modelling approaches to integrate all interactions into one canonical 4D model of a human dividing cell (figure 2). To come to a structural understanding of nuclear organisation, we will explore and further improve correlative imaging approaches, combining live cell confocal microscopy, SRM and electron tomography to unravel the mechanism of NPC assembly and disassembly, as well as the human genome architecture, chromatin organisation and compaction. To be able to apply systems biology tools to oocyte meiosis and early embryonic mitosis, we will push light-sheet-based imaging technology development further to improve its light efficiency and resolution in order to establish a physiological molecular model for early mammalian development and infertility.

Top: helical rod superimposed on cryomicrograph. Center: cross section comprising 17 subunits. Bottom: close-up of a-helix including sidechain density. The Sachse group uses electron cryomicroscopy to study the structures of autophagy complexes to elucidate the mechanisms by which cells eliminate aberrant structures such as large protein aggregates. Autophagy (from the Greek, meaning \u2018to eat oneself\u2019) is the cell\u2019s housekeeping mechanism to engulf and degrade longlived proteins, macromolecular aggregates, damaged organelles and even microbes in double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. In our group, we investigate the molecular structures involved in autophagy as they provide fundamental insights for our understanding of aberrant cellular processes like cancer, ageing or infection. We study the structures of molecular assemblies using biochemical and biophysical techniques, and subsequently visualise them by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). By this technique, large macromolecular structures and multi-protein complexes can be studied in their near-native environment without the need for crystallisation. Small amounts of material are sufficient to obtain \u2018snapshots\u2019 of single particles in the electron cryomicroscope. The molecular images are combined by computeraided image processing techniques to compute their 3D structures. As recent advances in hardware and software have led to a wave of atomic-resolution structures, cryo-EM shows great promise in becoming a routine tool for high-resolution structure determination of large macromolecules. To further realise the potential of the technique, the scientific community is still in great need of hardware-based improvements and software enhancements. Therefore, we are also interested in developing techniques, including sample preparation and data processing, to routinely achieve atomic-resolution structures by single-particle cryo-EM. For example, in our group we actively develop the software SPRING for high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination of specimens with helical symmetry.  Figure 2: Autophagy: A de novo double membrane vesicle entraps large cytosolic cargo such as macromolecules, organelles, protein aggregates and even pathogens destined for degradation in the lysosome. Multiprotein complexes are essential mediators in the events leading to autophagy. On the structural level however, little is known about their 3D architecture. Fundamental questions on the nature of these complexes need to be addressed: Spring is a single-particle based helical reconstruction package and has been used to determine 3D structures of a variety of highly ordered and less ordered specimens from electron micrographs.

### Peer Bork
\n\n Multiple roles for different microbial communities in the human gut (modified from the German newspaper Zeit covering the work of the group, original designed by J. Schievink). Metagenomic data from thousands of individuals from all over the world are analysed. For example, three stratifying gut microbial community types (enterotypes) have been discovered in the human population (Arumugam et al., 2011); shown are 1,000 individuals clustered by their gut microbial composition. Each individual is a dot, coloured by enterotype. The main focus of the Bork group is to gain insights into the functioning of biological systems and their evolution by comparative analysis and integration of complex molecular data. The group currently works on three different spatial scales, but with common underlying methodological frameworks: We usually work in new or emerging research areas and balance methodological work with biological discoveries. Past frontier research projects include the participation in the Human Genome Project (Lander et al., Nature 2001), foundational work on the study protein interaction networks (von Mering et al., Nature 2002) and comparative metagenomics (Tringe et al., Science 2005), and exploration of drug-target interactions using global human \u201creadouts\u201d such as side effects (Campillos et al., Science 2008). We currently have a number of ocean microbiome projects in the context of the TARA Oceans expedition (Bork et al., Science 2015 and references therein), however we mainly focus on the human gut microbiome. We employ metagenomics to uncover the principles of microbial communities in healthy and diseased humans. We identified three main \u201centerotypes\u201d \u2013 or gut microbial community compositions \u2013 in developed countries (Arumugam et al., Nature 2011), and showed that each human appears to carry individual strains (Schloissnig et al., Nature 2013). We found microbial markers for a number of diseases such as obesity (Le Chatelier et al., Nature 2013) and colon cancer (Zeller et al., Mol.Sys.Biol. 2014) and could demonstrate the impact of drugs on the gut microbiome (Forslund et al., Nature 2015). Furthermore, the environment in the human gut also impacts the efficacy of orally administered drugs: we try to repurpose existing drugs and to understand more about human biology using large-scale integration of various molecular and phenotypic datasets (Kuhn et al., Mol. Sys. Biol. 2013, Iskar et al., Mol. Sys. Biol. 2013) and also study the impact of drugs on the microbiome. We aim to develop the basics for community-based population genetics to understand how microbial communities are transmitted or evolve. This requires studies of communities at the strain level (i.e. of genetic variations). We will monitor strains worldwide and try to use them to understand the principles of successful fecal microbiota transplantations. In the future, we hope to connect microbiomics with diet, host interactions and drug intake. In this regard, we will continue to explore networks between proteins and chemicals such as lipids or carbohydrates and link them to phenotypic data such as disease status, side effects or toxicology. To foster translational research, the group is also partially associated with the\xa0Max Delbr\xfcck Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin and with the\xa0Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit at the University of Heidelberg. We also contribute to EMBL\u2019s Bio-IT community and the development of the internal EMBL Bio-IT portal to help network and facilitate the work of bioinformaticians in the EMBL community. We also contribute to EMBL's Bio-IT community and the development of the communities internal EMBL Bio-IT portal.

 Figure 1: The four steps involved in ER to Golgi transport in mammalian cells. (I): Biogenesis of COPII coated vesicles occurs at specialised ER exit sites of the ER.(II): COPII vesicles homotypically fuse to form larger vesicular tubular transport carriers (VTCs) that are transported to the Golgi complex along microtubules.(III): VTCs arrive at the Golgi complex and fuse to it todeliver their cargo. (IV): Transport machinery and misrouted proteins are return back to the ER by a distinct class of carriers.  Figure 2: (A) Cells are cut by laser nano-surgery to generate a Golgiless karyoplast and Golgi containing Golgiplasts (arrowhead). Karyoplasts are then followed by time-lapse microscopy to monitor de novo Golgi biogenesis in living cells (B). The arrowhead points to the Golgi-like structure reforming after nano-surgery in karyoplasts. The Pepperkok team develops novel approaches to study the temporal and spatial organisation of membrane traffic and organelle biogenesis in the secretory pathway. While many of the core components of the secretory machinery have been identified and characterised to some detail in the past decades, still little is known about how all components function together and how they are regulated in response to extracellular stimuli, stress or differentiation. Transport of material from one organelle to the other involves several steps, which have to occur sequentially and thus require a high degree of control at the molecular level (see figure 1). In order to understand such regulation in the physiological system that contains all possible components involved in the intact cell, we have developed and applied microscopy-based approaches to systematically identify components that regulate the early secretory pathway and the biogenesis and maintenance of the Golgi complex, down to the genome level. We have also developed and applied high-throughput microscopy techniques to quantitatively image genetic or physical interactions of the components we identified. Network analyses of the components identified in our large-scale screens revealed links between early secretory pathway function, small GTP-binding protein regulation, actin and microtubule cytoskeleton organisation and growth factor mediated signalling. It provides a basis for understanding the global cellular organisation and regulation of the secretory pathway. In order to investigate the mechanisms of Golgi biogenesis we have developed an approach, using laser nanosurgery, to deplete living cells from their Golgi complex and subsequently analyse the \u2018Golgi-less\u2019 karyoplast by time-lapse light and electron microscopy (figure 2). With this approach we are able to show that Golgi biogenesis in mammalian cells occurs de novo from ER derived membranes by a self-organising mechanism that integrates Golgi biogenesis, ER-exit sites biogenesis and the organisation of the microtubule network. We will study the complement of components that our genome-wide screens identified as being involved in the early secretory pathway in further detail. An important question in this context will be if and how they participate in the temporal and spatial organisation of ER-exit sites and their function, and the biogenesis of the Golgi complex. Ultimately, we hope to be able to define and understand the molecular network(s) underlying trafficking at the ER/Golgi boundary and Golgi function, also considering their relationship to other cellular processes such as transcriptional control, lipid or general metabolism, or signalling and thus contribute towards a global molecular understanding of the living cell. The Pepperkok team develops novel approaches to study the temporal and spatial organisation of membrane traffic and organelle biogenesis in the secretory pathway.

### Jonas Ries
 Figure 1: Dual-colour super-resolution images of Cdc11 (red) and the cell-wall marker ConA (green) show the formation and disassembly of the Cdc11 ring.  Figure 2: Actin in yeast. Yeast expressing Abp1-mMaple imaged by localisation microscopy. Five fixed example sites at different\xa0 endocytic time points. The Ries group develops cutting-edge superresolution microscopy methods to determine structures of multi-protein assemblies in the cellular context. The resolution of optical microscopy is limited by diffraction to about 200 nm, which is much larger than the relevant length-scales in cell biology, defined for example by the size of organelles or multi-molecular complexes. Single-molecule localisation-based super-resolution microscopy (localisation microscopy) overcomes this limit by stochastic activation and subsequent localisation of individual fluorophores, reaching a resolution in the 10 nm range. In the past, we worked on improved labelling schemes for super-resolution microscopy. We established nanobodies as tiny, high-affinity labels, which allow any GFP-tagged protein to be used directly for localisation microscopy. As an alternative to using photo-switchable fluorophores, we introduced binding-activated localisation microscopy (BALM), which employs fluorescence enhancement of fluorogenic dyes upon binding to target structures for superresolution microscopy, to study DNA structures and alpha-synuclein amyloids and demonstrated a superb labelling density combined with a very high resolution. Currently, one focus of the group is the development of new tools for superresolution microscopy. In one project, we are establishing a robust and simple method for isotropic 3D resolution based on supercritical angle fluorescence detection. Furthermore, we aim at measuring absolute copy numbers of proteins in large complexes by using artificial brightness standards. Combining localisation microscopy with electron microscopy in a correlative approach allows us to add molecular specificity to the ultrastructure. Single-molecule microscopy with light-sheet illumination reduces the background in thick samples. A second focus of our work is the application of our newly developed tools to address cell biological questions. Here, we are aiming to chart a comprehensive superresolved structural picture of the endocytic machinery as well as of the kinetochore complex in S. Cerevisiae. This has been impossible so far with conventional techniques due to their complexity and small size. Furthermore, we are investigating intracellular aggregation of Parkinsons\u2019 alpha-synuclein. We are also developing novel data analysis tools and an open-source software platform for super-resolution microscopy. This will allow us to extract information about protein structures from super-resolution microscopy data. Our vision is to establish super-resolution microscopy as a tool for structural cell biology in situ to bridge the methodological gap that currently exists between cell biology and structural biology techniques. We aim to push its limits on all fronts to establish a technique which combines nanometre 3D resolution with maximum labelling efficiencies, absolute measurements of protein copy numbers, precise dual-colour measurements, high-throughput for large scale statistics and novel data analysis approaches, to address exciting biological questions, which were previously inaccessible.

 Figure 1: An array of mitotic spindles obtained in vitro with Xenopus laevis egg extracts (Dinarina et al., Cell, 2009).  Figure 2: The metaphase spindle, a dynamic bipolar structure of filaments called microtubules (white) that are connected by molecular motors (orange). This simulation elucidates how a spindle can remain stable for hours, even though it is made of filaments that individually exist for less than a minute (Loughlin et al. 2010). The N\xe9d\xe9lec group develops in vitro experiments and modelling tools to explore complex intracellular processes, such as mitosis. Modern microscopy has demonstrated the dynamic nature of biological organisation. The mitotic spindle, for example, is a stable and solid cellular structure: in a given cell type, it has a precise symmetry and very reproducible dimensions. Yet, except for the chromosomes, all the components of a spindle \u2013 polar filaments called microtubules and associated proteins \u2013 are in rapid turnover. Microtubules grow, shrink and disappear in less than a minute and their associated proteins continuously and stochastically bind and unbind even faster. The resulting assembly, although highly dynamic, is remarkably precise: it can remain steady for hours waiting for the right signal, to eventually apply the balanced forces necessary to position and segregate the chromosomes exactly. The spindle is thus a fascinating structure that illustrates a central question in biology: how can the uncoordinated and inevitably imperfect actions of proteins and other molecules collectively fulfil the biological needs with the required accuracy? Today, understanding biological phenomena from their multiple biological components seems within our reach, as testified by the rise of systems biology. Yet, collective behaviours in biology require more than statistical averages. Understanding such complex collective behaviours is challenging for many reasons: 1) the diversity of molecular players is enormous; 2) their interactions are often dynamic and out-of-equilibrium; and 3) the properties of the constituents have been selected by natural evolution. We approach this topic in practical terms by developing in vitro experiments and modelling tools, allowing us to reduce the number of components in the system: we can either remove specific proteins, or start from scratch by mixing purified components. Modelling allows us to recapitulate the process of protein organisation in a framework in which all the interactions are known exactly and can even be specified at will. We have developed an advanced simulation engine \u2013 called Cytosim \u2013 to simulate ensembles of multiple polar fibres and associated proteins, which can simulate problems involving microtubules, actin filaments or both. Simulations are often used to validate or refute existing ideas, but we also try to use them in a more creative way: one can generate systematically various properties for the molecules and automatically test their ability to form stable structures. The analysis of successful scenarios leads to the formulation of new hypotheses. We will study systems in which experiments and theory can be synergistically combined. We currently focus on Xenopus egg extracts, an experimental system in which many aspects of mitosis can be recapitulated. We are also generally interested in modelling cellular processes in which the cytoskeleton is a major player, such as the different stages of mitosis, the generation of cell shape in S. pombe, or the generation of asymmetry during cell division.

 Figure 1: The zebrafish migrating lateral line organ allows collective migration to be easily studied in vivo.  Figure 2: Visualising actin dynamics (LifeAct-GFP) within migrating primordium. Using the zebrafish as a model, the Gilmour group takes an integrative, multiscale approach to study how cells collectively migrate and assemble into functional organs. Collective behaviour lies at the heart of all biological design. Whether it is the assembly of proteins into complexes or the organisation of animal societies, collective interaction creates something much greater than the sum of the parts. A breathtaking example of such behaviour is seen during embryogenesis, when thousands of collectively migrating cells self-organise to form functional tissues and organs. Given the key role played by collective migration in organ formation, wound repair and cancer, it is surprisingly how little we know about how cells organise each other. We take an integrative, multi-scale approach to study how cells collectively migrate and assemble into functional organs, using the zebrafish lateral line organ as an experimental model. Here, a migrating epithelial primordium comprising of 100 cells, assembles and deposits a series of rosette-like mechanosensory organs across the surface of the embryo. Its superficial migration route, beneath a single transparent cell layer, makes it the dream in vivo sample for quantitative imaging. Moreover, the process can be interrogated using a range of perturbation approaches, such as chemical and optogenetics, and many of the molecular regulators of its migratory behaviour are of general interest due to their role in human disease. For example, the migrating collective is guided by Cxcr4/SDF1 signalling, a chemokine-receptor pair known to control many human cancers.\xa0 The focus of our group is to use the lateral line to address the general question of how cell behaviours are regulated and coordinated within collectively migrating tissues. We have developed in vivo imaging, analysis and perturbation tools that allow the entire morphogenesis process to be addressed at different spatiotemporal scales. By integrating these data, using statistical methods and modelling, we are aiming to understand the interplay between \u2018opposing\u2019 behaviours \u2013 namely, cell migration and differentiation. In this way, we hope to move towards a systems-level understanding of how dynamic cell organisation and gene expression are integrated during tissue morphogenesis.

Each row shows a time-series heat map. Arrow denotes the addition of an aversive odor. Located in the Cell Biology and Biophysics Unit, EMBL Heidelberg. Affiliated with the Developmental Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg, and the Mouse Biology Unit, EMBL Monterotondo. The Prevedel group develops new optical techniques for investigating dynamic cellular processes deep inside tissue in-vivo. Light microscopy has revolutionized our understanding in many areas of biology, and over the years tremendous progress has been achieved by imaging cellular and subcellular processes in transparent, fixed, or thin sample preparations. Yet in order to obtain a complete understanding of biological processes, in-vivo studies inside thick, three-dimensional living tissues are often required. However, when light interacts with thick biological tissue, the process of light scattering leads to low-resolution, \u2018blurry\u2019 images and an effective loss of excitation power with increasing imaging depth. This has severely limited the biomedical usefulness of light microscopy to, e.g., cultured cells in vitro or superficial layers of tissue in vivo. New approaches and tools are thus required to noninvasively image biological function at depth inside living tissue with sufficient resolution, speed and contrast. In the past, we have developed novel optical techniques for high-speed imaging, with a particular focus on functional imaging in the neurosciences. Amongst others, we have put forward a two-photon microscopy technique based on light-sculpting that has enabled the first whole-brain calcium imaging in C. elegans. In other work, we have established light-field deconvolution microscopy, an elegant approach to perform volumetric imaging that achieves unprecedented acquisition speeds while requiring no mechanical scanning. Currently, we extend our imaging methods to the scattering tissue domain and combine our approach with longer-wavelength excitation and red-shifted indicators, which collectively allow for larger imaging depth. Together with our collaborators, we apply our methods to study neuronal activity in a range of model organisms such as C. elegans, zebrafish larvae and behaving mice. The future focus of the group is to push the frontiers of deep tissue microscopy in terms of imaging depths and resolution by developing advanced and innovative optical imaging techniques. To do so we will draw from diverse fields such as multi-photon microscopy, active wave-front shaping, photo-acoustics as well as computational imaging. In particular, we aim to bridge the technological gap in spatial resolution and imaging depth that exists between optical microscopy and longer wavelength approaches such as photo-acoustics. We intend to combine these into multi-modal imaging systems that allow studying cellular processes and dynamics at depths inaccessible so far by conventional microscopy. Our multidisciplinary team comprises of physicists, engineers, computer scientists and biologists, and we engage in close collaboration with fellow groups at EMBL in the fields of cell and developmental biology as well as neuroscience.

Science\xa02013: Paradis-Bleau et al., PLoS Gen 2014). \xa0  Figure 2: A.

A signal transduction system for monitoring b-barrel insertion into the bacterial outer membrane (Cho et al., Cell 2014). The Typas group develops and utilises high-throughput methods to study the cellular networks of different bacterial species, and how these bacteria interact with the environment and with each other. The recent explosion of genomic sequence information provides a first step towards better understanding diverse bacteria, but also makes it crucial to develop large-scale phenotyping approaches to characterise functions of novel genes and to map them within pathways. We are developing such high-throughput, multi-readout, automated approaches to quantitatively assess gene-gene, gene-drug and drug-drug interactions in many different bacteria and at many different levels (figure 1). We then use the data as starting points for generating new mechanistic insights into targeted cellular processes, and also for uncovering how function, regulation and cross-talk between cellular processes changes across evolution and how this impacts the phenotype. Our biological focus is on the bacterial envelope \u2013 its mode of assembly and growth, and its ability to sense the environment. The bacterial envelope is vital for pathogenesis, cell morphogenesis and cell developmental programs. Although many envelope structural components have been characterised, we often have limited information on how their biosynthesis and transport are interconnected, regulated, or linked to the overall status of the cell, how the cell senses perturbations in these process and how signals are transduced to achieve homeostasis. Working at the intersection between genomics and mechanistic molecular biology, we have discovered key missing players of major envelope components, uncovered niche-specific regulation of conserved envelope processes, identified linking proteins that allow coordination between processes, and mapped network rewiring under different stresses (figure 2). We are also developing large-scale automated platforms for elucidating the mode-of-action of new antibacterials, for large-scale profiling of combinatorial drug therapies and for dissecting the underlying mechanism(s), and for identifying adjuvants that re-sensitise multi-resistant bacterial pathogens or target chronic infections (persisters). Our ultimate goal is to identify rules underlying drug-drug interactions that will allow rational design, and to find solutions for difficult to kill pathogens. We are now expanding our efforts in two directions. First, we are introducing our high-throughput screening approaches into abundant and prevalent species of the human gut microbiome. In collaboration with the Alexandrov, Bork, and Patil groups, and utilising a plethora of complementary technologies \u2013 such as imaging mass spectrometry, cutting-edge microscopy approaches, meta-omics, modeling \u2013, we aim at understanding the dynamics of such communities, and how their composition is affected by drugs, natural and dietary compounds, physical parameters, and host molecules. Secondly, we are setting up a multi-pronged systematic approach aimed at gaining novel insights into the host-pathogen interface. Here, we combine high-throughput reverse genetics, high-content microscopy and different types of quantitative proteomics to dissect the\xa0Salmonella-host interaction.

### Orsolya Barabas
 Figure 1: The Sleeping Beauty transposase \u2013 DNA complex showing intimate interaction of the protein (blue) with specific transposon end (grey) and target (black) DNA that governs and regulates a series of chemical steps during transposition. The Barabas group uses structural and molecular biology approaches to investigate how DNA rearrangements are carried out and regulated, and uses this knowledge to develop their applications in research and medicine. Our research focuses on transposons, a class of mobile genetic elements that can autonomously move from one location to another in the genome. They drive genetic diversity, adaptation and evolution and constitute a large fraction of most genomes. However, the physiological roles of transposons are just starting to be unravelled. They largely contribute to antibiotic resistance transfer in bacteria, creating a pressing public health concern. Recent discoveries also show that they have key functions in gene regulation, development, immunity, and neurogenesis in animals. Finally, these \u2018jumping\u2019 DNA elements offer innovative tools for genetics and human gene therapy. To better understand transposition and facilitate applications, we investigate the molecular mechanisms of their movement and regulation using a diverse methodological toolbox inclusding structural and molecular biology, biochemistry, biophysics, bioinformatics, microbiology, and cell biology approaches. We strive to understand the structure of functional transposition complexes, the chemistry they use to cut and paste DNA, their target-site selection, their abundance in genomes (Smyshlyaev et al. 2013; Bock et al. 2014), and their regulation in the cell. Major focus is on eukaryotic transposons that provide genetic tools, antibiotic resistance-carrying elements, and transposon regulation by small RNAs. This transposon is a prime tool in vertebrate genetics and human gene/cell therapy. We study its structure and mechanisms, investigate how it interacts with other components of human host cells, and develop advanced variants for genetic engineering. We have recently determined the crystal structure of the catalytic part of the Sleeping Beauty transposase, which allowed us to design novel hyperactive variants for therapeutic applications (Voigt et al., 2016, Press Release: Designing gene therapy). One of the main obstacles in gene therapy is integration of the therapeutic gene at unwanted locations. Our work revealed that the IS608 transposon uses part of its own sequence to guide integration to a specific site via base pairing (Barabas et al., 2008). We are now testing if this target recognition mode can be extended to select unique genomic sites. The spread of antibiotic resistance is one of today\u2019s biggest medical challenges. Conjugative transposons (CTns) actively transfer resistance genes across bacterial cells and species, consituting a great risk for resistance dissemination. We study the mechanisms of CTn movement at atomic detail and in bacterial communities with the ultimte goal of desiging intervention startegies to limit their spreading. To avoid deleterious outcomes, higher eukaryotes keep their transposons under tight control. One major control mechanism is provided by small RNAs and our group investigates these processes in prokaryotes (Schulz et al., 2014) and eukaryotes. Our recent work on the piRNA pathway has revealed the structure and function of a novel factor called Zucchini (Voigt et al., 2012).

### Edward Lemke
The Lemke group uses an interdisciplinary approach to elucidate the nature of naturally disordered proteins in biological systems and disease mechanisms at the single molecule level. Currently, more than 100 000 protein structures with atomic resolution are available from the protein databank. However, even if all 3D protein structures were available, our view of the molecular building blocks of cellular function would still be incomplete, as we now know that many proteins are intrinsically disordered \xad\xad\u2013 unfolded in their native state. Interestingly, the estimated percentage of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) grows with the complexity of the organism (eukaryotes \u2248 50%). Their ability to adopt multiple conformations is considered a major driving force behind their evolution and enrichment in eukaryotes. Most common strategies for probing protein structure are incompatible with the highly dynamic nature of molecular disorder, so that 50% of the proteome remains \u201cdark\u201d, or invisible. In contrast, single molecule and super-resolution techniques, which directly probe the distribution of molecular events, can reveal important mechanisms that otherwise remain obscured. In particular, highly time-resolved advanced fluorescence tools allow probing of molecular structures and dynamics at near atomic scale down to picosecond resolution. While such experiments are now possible in the natural environment of the entire cell, single molecule fluorescence studies\xa0in vitro\xa0and\xa0in vivo\xa0suffer from several limitations such as low throughput and the need for site-specific labelling with special fluorescent dyes. In particular the latter one has become a major bottle neck in state of the art fluorescence. Besides developing new spectroscopy and microscopy methods, we are utilising a large spectrum of chemical biology and protein engineering tools to overcome these limitations. Our bioengineering efforts allow us to reprogram cells in a way that enables the custom tailoring of proteins with diverse probes, such as dyes and post-translational modifications. This will ultimately enable us to transform living organisms into ideal test beds for molecular, biophysical, and even physiochemical studies of molecular function. Our chemical biology tools also present an ideal interface between the life and material sciences. Furthermore, microfluidics and its potential to miniaturise lab efforts and increase throughput of single molecule science is an area we explore efficiently. Recent studies have shown that even the building blocks with an absolutely critical role in cell survival are largely built from IDPs. For example, many nucleoporins are central\xa0 to nucleocytoplasmic transport, but also in oncogenesis, chromatin organisation, epigenetic mechanisms, and transcription. Furthermore, viruses extensively use reprogramming of critical IDPs to gain access to, and modify, cellular genomes. How multifunctionality can be encoded into protein disorder is a central question in biology that we aim to answer, as well as integrating our knowledge about such biopolymers towards a better understanding of the life sciences, better drug design, and exploration for bio-inspired material sciences. Chemistry at EMBL Physics and Engineering at EMBL \n\n Figure 1: We innovate new tools, and combine those with our home-built, highly sensitive single molecule and super-resolution equipment to study structure and dynamics of heterogeneous biological systems and pathways, such as viral host pathogen mechanisms and nuclear pore complexes in 4D, and how malfunction of those can lead to disease. We also aim to explore the potential of these IDP biopolymers for novel applications in the life and material sciences. Find out more about the European Research Council

The M\xfcller group uses X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, biophysical and biochemical approaches to learn about the molecular mechanisms of transcription regulation in eukaryotes, where DNA is packaged into chromatin. We study how sequence-specific transcription factors assemble on DNA and how they interact with co-activators and general transcription factors to recruit RNA polymerases to their transcription start sites. We are also interested in the overall structure, architecture and the inner workings of large molecular machines involved in the transcription process, such as RNA polymerases I and III, their specific pre-initiation complexes and chromatin modifying complexes. Finally, we would like to gain insight into how DNA sequence information and epigenetic modifications work together to regulate gene transcription. To achieve these goals, we use structural information obtained by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy combined with other biophysical and biochemical approaches. RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and III (Pol III) consist of 14 and 17 subunits, respectively. Whereas Pol I is responsible for the biosynthesis of ribosomal RNA, Pol III synthesises small RNAs like tRNA and 5S RNA. Misregulation of Pol I and Pol III has been associated with different types of cancer. We are studying the overall architecture of the Pol I and Pol III enzymes and of their pre-initiation machineries using a broad and interdisciplinary approach that combines integrated structural biology with\xa0in vitro\xa0and\xa0in vivo\xa0functional analysis. Analysing the Pol I and Pol III transcription process in detail will help us to understand what features make the Pol I and Pol III machineries particularly suitable to fulfil their respective tasks, how Pol I and Pol III transcription is regulated, and how Pol I and Pol III transcripts get further processed. The accessibility of chromatin in eukaryotes is regulated by ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling factors and histone modifying enzymes. We study the molecular architecture of chromatin-modifying complexes \u2013 such as Polycomb group (PcG) protein complexes \u2013, how they are recruited, interact with nucleosomes, and are regulated.

 Figure 1: Molecular cartography of stem cells: miRNA expression classifies pluripotent cells, cancer cells and differentiated cells. This map allows to follow quantitatively changes in cell identity such as differentiation and reprogramming. It reveals that reprogramming goes through a cancer-like behaviour.  Figure 2: mouse ESC colony expressing a fluorescent reporter of miR-142 activity. The Neveu group takes an integrated systems biology approach to investigate the molecular changes that determine what a stem cell becomes. Pluripotent cells have the dual ability to self-renew and differentiate. Therefore, in pluripotent cells, the expression of hundreds of genes should be stable in the self-renewal case, but gene expression can also be directed in a coordinated manner towards particular states upon external signalling cues (lineage commitment towards terminal differentiation). Deciphering this complex problem has garnered much attention at the systems level. Tackling this challenge requires good characterisation of the pluripotent state. miRNAs are suitable marker candidates because they are excellent classifiers of tissue types or cellular states and they also play a crucial role in differentiation. By profiling miRNA expression in human cells, we have previously shown that pluripotency surprisingly emerges as a much more diverse state than previously believed: variability in miRNA expression is comparable to that found in differentiated cells and cancer cells. We have also shown that it is possible to dramatically reduce the complexity of miRNA expression patterns to a few meaningful dimensions, suggesting that complex processes of the stem cell system, such as differentiation and reprogramming, can be mapped quantitatively. Currently, we are employing a dynamic approach at the single cell level to resolve the dynamics of differentiation and the different molecular and cellular processes at play during fate determination. Indeed, differentiation is intrinsically a dynamic process, where individual cells have to change from one state to another. Having developed fluorescent reporters to assess miRNA expression in single cells, we are characterising mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal using single-cell live imaging. We have found that the miRNA miR-142 is bimodally expressed in self-renewing mouse ESCs. miR-142 expression stratifies ESCs into two distinct subpopulations that interconvert stochastically: one subpopulation able to differentiate and a subpopulation deaf to differentiation cues. miR-142 expression creates this phenotypic diversity by switching the activation status of key intracellular signalling pathways. We plan to study the dynamics of differentiation at the single-cell level both in vitro in mouse embryonic stem cells and in vivo. The ultimate goal is to dissect the transcriptional regulation and gene networks and the associated cellular changes underlying stem cell differentiation. We are taking an integrated systems biology approach that combines single-cell live imaging of miRNA expression, image processing, perturbation approaches, and mathematical modelling. We wish to address the following questions:

### Georg Zeller
The Zeller team develops computational tools for metagenomics data analysis to elucidate the microbiome\u2019s role in human health and disease and its responses to chemical perturbations, such as drug treatments. The human microbiome, the complex ecosystem of microorganisms colonising our body, has increasingly been recognised as an important determinant of human physiology. Detailed investigations of microbes in situ (without culturing) have become possible through advances in sequencing technology and computational analysis methodology. These have now started to be applied in large clinical studies to associate changes in microbiome composition and function with human diseases. However, analysis and interpretation of such data remains challenging: To address these challenges, we are actively contributing to the development of software tools for accurate profiling of both previously sequenced as well as uncharacterised microbial species and the functions encoded in their genomes and transcriptomes. To associate changes in these profiles with various host phenotypes of interest, we have investigated various statistics and machine learning tools and evaluated their applicability to microbiome sequencing data and are currently making software pipelines publicly available that automate such analyses. Using these, we have recently demonstrated that gastro-intestinal diseases can be accurately detected from faecal microbiome readouts. For colorectal cancer in particular this has potential for developing novel non-invasive screening methods (see figure).  Figure 1: Colorectal cancer (CRC) can be detected using a classification approach based on microbial markers (top panel) quantified in faecal samples by metagenomic sequencing; its accuracy was evaluated in cross-validation and independent external validation (bottom panels) in comparison to the standard non-invasive screening test (FOBT Hemoccult).

\n\n Figure 1: An example region on chromosome 10 displaying the HiC score (blue), local histone QTLs (on the diagonal) and distal hQTLs (off diagonal). Most distal-QTLs lie within the same chromatin domain (indicated in black squares) as their target peak. The Zaugg group investigates the variation of molecular phenotypes among individuals along with their genetic variation with the aim of better understanding the molecular basis of complex genetic diseases and inter-individual differences in drug response. One of the continuing challenges in biomedical research, in particular in translating personalised molecular medicine to the clinic, is to understand the contribution of genetic variation to hereditary traits and diseases. Genome-wide association studies have revealed thousands of associations between genetic variants and complex diseases. However, since most of these variants lie in non-coding parts of the genome, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations is lagging far behind the number of known associations. To gain a better mechanistic insight into potential causes of known genotype-disease associations, our lab is investigating the variability of molecular phenotypes among individuals and trying to link them to genetic variation. In addition, since many of the disease-associated SNPs are located in regulatory elements, we have a general interest in understanding gene regulatory mechanisms. Our recent findings indicate that about 15 percent of all regulatory elements, measured through chromatin marks by ChiP-Seq, have a genetic basis, thus challenging the traditional view of chromatin being an epigenetic mark. Many of these so-called histone quantitative trait loci (hQTLs) also have an effect on distal genes or regulatory elements (A) through a mechanism that is likely mediated by transcription factors (B). Importantly, these hQTLs are highly enriched for SNPs that have previously been found to associate with complex traits or diseases, highlighting the functional significance of studying inter-individual variation of molecular phenotypes. We are currently investigating potential mechanisms, such as enhancer compensation models as well as transcript isoform variation, to understand the complex relationship between gene expression and regulatory elements. In the future we will expand our efforts to contributing to the understanding of complex traits and diseases along three lines of research: \n\n Figure 2: H3K27ac ChIP-seq signal surrounding H3K27ac QTLs was extracted and grouped into six clusters. The aggregate signals for the six clusters are shown for the high-, heterozygous- and low-genotypes (blue, purple, red) for H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and DNase hypersensitivity sites (DHS) (left to right). The QTL SNPs lie in the nucleosome free regions, indicating that TFs might be driving hQTLs.

### Alexander Aulehla
The Aulehla group studies how the precise timing and sequence of events that unfold as an embryo develops are controlled. During an embryo\u2019s journey from a single cell to a complex organism, countless patterning processes unfold with remarkable precision, spatially but also in respect to temporal sequence, or timing. This temporal aspect of embryonic development is the focus of our research. How is time measured during embryonic development and what extrinsic and intrinsic signals control this timing? How are embryonic oscillators/clocks employed during patterning? What are the dynamics of signalling pathways? To approach these questions, novel methodologies are required (see video 1). We are generating novel real-time reporter mouse lines using knock-in technology that enables visualisation and quantification of temporal dynamics at different levels in the context of mouse embryonic development. Using in vivo imaging, we are focusing on the somite segmentation clock, an oscillatory system that is thought to control the formation of the pre-vertebrae that form periodically in a head-to tail sequence within the paraxial mesoderm. In mouse embryos this clock, with a periodicity of around two hours, drives oscillatory activity of several signalling pathways (Wnt, Notch and Fgf signalling) in the developing mesoderm.

From this quantification, critical oscillation parameters, wave speed and phase-distributions can be calculated. We recently developed an ex vivo assay that, in combination with real-time imaging reporters, has become instrumental for our approach: the assay recapitulates mesoderm patterning, including segment formation and spatio-temporally controlled oscillatory signalling activities, within the simplified context of a monolayer of primary mesoderm cells put in culture (see figure & video 2). One fundamental property of vertebrate segment formation is its ability to maintain proportions even when overall embryo size is experimentally altered, a process termed scaling. Intriguingly, scaling behaviour can be observed in the ex vivo assay system as well. This enabled us to identify a novel scaling mechanism employing phase-shifted oscillatory activity (Lauschke et al., 2013). One major interest is how temporal devices, or oscillators, mechanistically encode spatial information for patterning, particularly at an integrated, higher-order level, so as to reveal emergent properties, incorporating mathematical modelling into our approach. This signalling pathway serves a multitude of evolutionarily conserved functions during development and has been shown to play an essential role during somite formation. Our novel real-time reporter system is designed to reflect oscillatory Wnt-signalling activity both at gene activity and at protein levels. This will enable us to determine how the striking oscillations of Wnt-signalling activity are generated in the first place and, moreover, to functionally test their role in embryonic patterning, particularly identifying the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that are responsible for controlling these oscillations within the segmentation process.

 Figure 1: Model for the organisation of mitotic chromosomes by condensin rings.  Figure 2: The live-cell chromosome condensation assay tracks the distances between two fluorescently labelled chromosome loci over time. Alignment of a large number of single cell tracks (circles) to the time of anaphase onset (t = 0) generates an average distance plot (line) as a quantitative read-out of condensation dynamics. The H\xe4ring group aims to understand the molecular machinery that organises chromosomes to allow their correct distribution among daughter cells. Eukaryotic chromosomes undergo enormous changes in structure and organisation over the course of a cell cycle. One of the most fascinating changes is the transformation of interphase chromatin into rod-shaped mitotic chromosomes in preparation for cell division. This process, known as chromosome condensation, is a key step for the successful segregation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. The underlying mechanisms are, however, still poorly understood. The overall aim of our research is to unravel the action of molecular machines that organise the 3D architecture of eukaryotic genomes. Insights into the general working principles behind these machines will be of great importance to our understanding of how cells inherit a complete set of their chromosomes every time they divide and thereby prevent the emergence of aneuploidies, which are hallmarks of most cancer cells and the leading cause of spontaneous miscarriages in humans. One of the central players in the formation of mitotic chromosomes is a highly conserved multi-subunit protein complex, known as condensin. We have shown that condensin encircles chromosomal DNA within a large ring structure formed by its structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) and kleisin subunits. Our working hypothesis is that condensin uses this topological principle to tie together loops of chromatin (figure 1), which ensures that chromosome arms clear the site of cell cleavage before cytokinesis. In an independent project, we use a newly developed time-resolved light microscopy assay to quantitatively measure chromosome condensation in live fission yeast cells in high-throughput (figure 2). This has identified, in addition to condensin, new players that direct the formation of mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. We will continue to use a highly interdisciplinary approach to advance our understanding of condensin function in yeast and mammalian cells by combining biochemical, molecular, structural, and cell biology methods. In collaboration with other groups, we are taking further advantage of chemical biological techniques as well as single-molecule approaches to discover how condensin loads onto chromosomes, how it interacts with other chromosomal components, and how its activity is controlled. In addition, we are further investigating the novel candidates identified in the screen for mitotic chromosome condensation proteins to understand the basis of their functions on mitotic chromosomes.

 Figure 1: Cryo-electron tomogram of a fraction of the cytoplasm of a human cell. Microtubules are coloured in orange, stress fibres in grey, protein complexes in green, membranes in cyan and vesicular contents in yellow.  Figure 2: Model of the scaffold arrangement of the human Nuclear Pore Complex revealed by an integrated approach consisting of cryo-electron tomography, single particle EM, cross-linking MS and structural modelling (Bui, von Appen et al., Cell, 2013). Research in the Beck group combines biochemical approaches, proteomics and cryo-electron microscopy to study large macromolecular assemblies. Research in our laboratory combines biochemical approaches, proteomics and cryo-electron microscopy to study the structure and function of large macromolecular assemblies. Cryo-electron tomography is the ideal tool to observe molecular machines at work in their native environment (figure 1). Since the attainable resolution of the tomograms is moderate, the challenge ahead is to integrate information provided by complementary approaches in order to bridge the resolution gap towards high-resolution techniques (NMR, X-ray crystallography). Mass spectrometry approaches can provide the auxiliary information that is necessary to tackle this challenge. Targeted mass spectrometry can handle complex protein mixtures and, in combination with heavy labelled reference peptides, provides quantitative information about protein stoichiometries. Using this together with cross-linking techniques can reveal protein interfaces. The spatial information obtained in this way facilitates the fitting of high-resolution structures into cryo-EM maps in order to build pseudo-atomic models of entire molecular machines (figure 2). Megadalton protein complexes are involved in a number of fundamental cellular processes such as cell division, vesicular trafficking and nucleocytoplasmic exchange. In most cases such molecular machines consist of a multitude of different proteins that occur in several copies within an individual assembly. Their function is often fine-tuned towards context specific needs by compositional remodelling across different cell-types. Structural variations occur through stoichiometric changes, subunit switches or competing protein interfaces. Studying the structure and function of Megadalton protein complexes is a challenging task, not only due to their compositional complexity but also because of their sheer size, which makes them inaccessible to biochemical purification.

### Christoph Merten
 Micro\ufb02uidic approaches in drug discovery and personalised medicine The Merten group develops micro\ufb02uidic technology to address complex questions in biomedical sciences and developmental biology. Working on the micro-scale offers some unique advantages: During the past couple of years we have established powerful micro\ufb02uidic platforms for cell-based and biochemical assays. We continuously develop novel micro\ufb02uidic chips, detection systems and software (mainly LabVIEW) for the discovery of new drugs and antibodies, partially in collaboration with large pharma industry. Furthermore, we use microfluidic technology to predict optimal (personalised) drug cocktails for cancer therapy. The group is very interdisciplinary and consists of people with various backgrounds, including biologists, engineers and programmers. However, prior knowledge in microfluidics is not mandatory for joining! For most applications we use two-phase micro\ufb02uidics, in which aqueous droplets within an immiscible oil phase serve as miniaturised reaction vessels. As they can be generated at kilohertz frequencies, they are of particular interest for high-throughput screens. Furthermore, the small assay volumes (pico- to nanoliters) facilitate the obtainment of high concentrations of nucleic acids (mRNA, DNA) or proteins (such as secreted antibodies) from individually encapsulated cells, paving the way for single-cell assays. Sometimes we also use continuous-phase micro\ufb02uidics, for example to generate laminar \ufb02ow patterns, to apply spatial constrictions, or to provide cells sequentially with different stimuli. This has turned out to be particularly useful for various developmental biology applications. Having a comprehensive micro\ufb02uidic toolbox at hand (and expanding it continuously), we are now focusing on applications in three different research \ufb01elds: Therapeutic antibodies: Droplet based micro\ufb02uidics enables to screen a large fraction of the murine and human immune repertoire in a single experiment. We are actively exploiting this for novel therapeutic approaches. Personalised medicine: We use microfluidic devices to test drug combinations directly on human tumor samples and to predict optimal therapies. Genomics: We are actively developing micro\ufb02uidic modules for single-cell barcoding and sequencing. This will enable the study of the mechanisms of drug resistance in great detail.    \xa0Encapsulation of HEK293T cells (left) and C. Elegans (right) into aqueous microcompartments.

### Detlev Arendt
 As a \u2018living fossil\u2019, Platynereis represents an ideal connecting link between vertebrates and the fast evolving protostome models, Drosophila and Caenorhabditis. Genomic resources and molecular techniques have been generated that make it a model marine invertebrate for ocean biology and for organismal systems biology. By studying and comparing simple marine organisms, the Arendt group looks to understand the origin and evolution of our central nervous system. We are intrigued by one of the remaining great mysteries in animal evolution: how did our central nervous system (CNS) come into existence? What did it look like at first and how did it function? We are especially interested in the CNS of an extinct animal known as Urbilateria, the last common ancestor of humans, flies and most other \u2018higher\u2019 animals that live today, which lived some 600 million years ago in the ocean. Our lab has chosen to investigate a new molecular animal model, the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii. As a \u2018living fossil\u2019, Platynereis represents an ideal connecting link between vertebrates and the fast evolving protostome models, Drosophila and Caenorhabditis. Platynereis is amenable to high throughput imaging techniques and functional interference approaches, for example the first genetic knockout lines have been generated. With the recent development of the PrImR (Profiling by Image Registration) resource, Platynereis has become the first animal model for which gene expression profiling data can be obtained in cellular resolution for the whole organism. We have discovered that their brains harbour sensory-associative parts and a neurosecretory centre that corresponds to the vertebrate pallium and hypothalamus, respectively. A clear picture is emerging that the Platynereis brain harbours many cell types so far known only for vertebrates, but in a much more simple and different overall arrangement, revolutionising our current understanding of brain evolution. To broaden our comparative approach, we have introduced two new model species to the lab, the lancelet amphioxus and the sea anemone Nematostella, representing distinct divisions of the animal kingdom: chordates and cnidarians. Amphioxus has a very simple brain uniting invertebrate- and vertebrate-like features. The Nematostella nervous system is very simple and is a good proxy for an early stage of nervous system evolution. Our aim is to gain a systems view of the Platynereis brain and nervous system and to track the evolutionary history of all constituent cell types by identifying and investigating their evolutionary counterparts in sea anemone and amphioxus. This will involve investigations of cell type-specific gene regulatory networks in all species as well as neurobiological and behavioural approaches. Our ERC-funded project \u2013 BrainEvoDevo \u2013 aims at generating a neuron-type atlas of the annelid larval brain by combining neuronal morphologies, axonal projections and cellular expression profiling for an entire bilaterian brain. It will be the first cellular resolution expression atlas for a whole animal nervous system involving early developmental and differentiation stages. Building on the Atlas, we will dissect Platynereis chemosensory-motor forebrain circuits, by laser ablation of GFP-labelled single neurons, gene knockout studies and behavioural assays based on microfluidics to explore duplication, divergence and expansion of neural circuits in central nervous system development and evolution. We are also interested in exploring population genetics and the variability of development and differentiation in different habitats and conditions. To this end, we are collecting strains of\xa0Platynereis\xa0and amphioxus as part of the TARA Oceans expedition and as an active member of the EMBL Oceans Team.

\n\n Figure 1: Surface mapping of two metabolites on the skin of female and male individuals. The models are overlaid with a molecular network in background showing the structural relations between these and hundreds of other detected metabolites (Bouslimani A, et al., PNAS, 2015). This study was highlighted as an Image of the Year by Nature in 2015. The Alexandrov team develops novel computational biology tools that aim to reveal the spatial organisation of metabolic processes. Metabolomics, the study of the chemical fingerprints left by cellular processes, is considered as a crucial research area, promising to advance our understanding of cell biology, physiology, and medicine. In the last years, metabolomics has progressed from cataloguing chemical structures to answering complex biomedical questions. The next frontier now lies in spatial metabolomics, where the challenge is to map the whole metabolome with cellular and sub-cellular spatial resolution and to develop a mechanistic understanding of metabolic processes in space, at the levels of cell populations, organs, and organisms. Our team contributes to the emerging field of spatial metabolomics by developing computational biology tools that enable imaging and functional interpretation of metabolites in tissue sections, agar plates, and cell cultures. The team is highly interdisciplinary and brings together expertise in mathematics, bioinformatics, and chemistry. We combine dry-lab research with the work in our wet lab equipped with cutting-edge instrumentation for metabolic imaging. \n\n Figure 2: 3D spatial localisation of two metabolites (green, a rhamnolipid with an inhibitory function, and blue) secreted within the agar medium by the interacting colonies of P. aeruginosa and C. albicans (Watrous et al., ISME J., 2013). Our tools exploit various analytical techniques based on mass spectrometry \u2013\xa0in particular high-resolution imaging mass spectrometry, which can generate 100 gigabytes of information-rich data in a single sample. Recently, we developed techniques for the molecular annotation of this big amount of data and applied it to various biological systems. We were able to visualise hundreds of metabolites with spatial resolution down to 5 \u03bcm in both 2D and 3D. Our applications include studying metabolic interactions of co-cultured microbial colonies, alterations in metabolic pathways due to therapy response in both cell cultures and model systems, and performing large-scale analysis of the human skin surface.

 Figure 1: Working model of PLD2\u2013TORC2 membrane tension negative feedback loop. This circuit forms a mechanosensory negative feedback loop that acts as a membrane tension homeostat and controls the spatial organisation of actin assembly during neutrophil polarity and movement.  Figure 2: Feedback between curvature and membrane tension. The Diz-Mu\xf1oz group studies the crosstalk between membrane tension and signalling for cell polarity and migration of immune cells and zebrafish mesendodermal precursors. For decades, research aimed at understanding cellular behaviour has largely focused on biochemical reactions. It is now well known that binding of soluble extracellular ligands to receptors on the plasma membrane can trigger lipid modifications, protein phosphorylation, and changes in protein localisation. More recently, it has become clear that physical forces also transmit critical information in cells and tissues, where they can regulate a wide variety of cell behaviours, including differentiation, death, movement and shape. At the cell surface, plasma membrane tension has been shown to integrate a wide variety of cell behaviours, ranging from determining leading edge size to regulating the balance between exocytosis and endocytosis. We are only beginning to understand the many ways in which physical forces, and in particular plasma membrane tension, modulate behaviour at the molecular, cellular, and tissue length cells. Current approaches to measure and manipulate forces have important limitations and new tools and techniques are needed to address these challenges. In the past we focused on the roles mechanics have in zebrafish cell migration and morphogenesis. We demonstrated that increasing cellular blebbing in mesendodermal cells (by reducing membrane tension or increasing intracellular pressure) impairs directed migration. Furthermore, we showed that the ratio of cellular protrusions (blebs to lamellipodia) controls the overall directional persistence of migration in a changing environment, such as in the developing zebrafish embryo. More recently, we have identified key components of a membrane tension-sensing pathway that controls leading edge formation in neutrophils (Figure 1). Our work sheds new light on how the plasma membrane integrates physical forces and intracellular signals to organise cell polarity during movement. Our primary interest lies in understanding the reciprocal interactions between physical forces and cellular signalling cascades during the establishment of cell polarity and subsequent cell motility in single cells and intact organisms. We will use a multi-scale and multi-disciplinary approach to develop novel ways to precisely quantify and modulate membrane tension (and membrane tension only) in an acute manner. Combining optogenetics, TIRF microscopy, 2-photon imaging, FRET sensors and atomic force microscopy, we will tackle how membrane tension/curvature affects signalling and vice-versa (Figure 2) to organise cell polarity during movement.

### Kiran Patil
The Patil group uses a combination of modelling, bioinformatics, and experimental approaches to study metabolic networks and how they are controlled. Metabolism is a fundamental cellular process that provides molecular building blocks and energy for growth and maintenance. In order to optimise the use of resources and to maximize fitness, cells respond to environmental or genetic perturbations through a highly coordinated regulation of metabolism. Research in the Patil group focuses on understanding the basic principles of operation and regulation of metabolic networks. We are particularly interested in developing models connecting genotype to the metabolic phenotype (metabolic fluxes and metabolite concentrations) in cell factories and in microbial communities. With a foundation in genome-scale metabolic modelling, optimisation methods and statistics, we develop novel computational algorithms that are driven by mechanistic insights. For example, we have previously shown that the transcriptional changes in metabolic networks are organised around key metabolites that are crucial for responding to the underlying perturbations (see figure). \n\n A microbial community can use the biosynthetic capabilities of its members to decrease the collective dependence on nutritional availability from the environment. The figure illustrates this concept using a toy model (left panel) and shows simulation results for communities of different size assembled from a pool of 1200 species (right panel). The metabolic models used here contain around 1000 reactions per species. We complement our computational analyses with experimental activities carried out within our group (microbial physiology and genetics) and in close collaboration with other groups at EMBL and elsewhere (high-throughput phenotyping, metabolomics, proteomics etc.). Such combination of computational and experimental approaches has previously enabled us to improve yeast cell factories producing vanillin \u2013 a popular flavouring agent. We are currently developing novel tools, concepts and applications in the following research areas: i) Metabolic interactions in microbial communities: Microbial communities are ubiquitous in nature and have a large impact on ecological processes and human health. A major focus of our current activities is the development of computational and experimental tools for mapping competitive and cooperative metabolic interactions in natural as well as in synthetic microbial communities. With the help of these tools, we aim at uncovering the role of inter-species interactions in shaping the diversity and stability of complex microbial communities. ii) Computer-aided design of cell factories: Cell factories, such as yeast and CHO cells, are at the heart of biotechnological processes for sustainable production of various chemicals and pharmaceuticals. We are using modelling and bioinformatics tools to identify genetic re-design strategies towards improving the productivity of such cell factories. These strategies guide our experimental implementation, which in turn help us to further improve the design algorithms in an iterative fashion. We also contribute to EMBL's Bio-IT community and the development of the communities internal EMBL Bio-IT portal. This resource aims to help network and facilitate the work of bioinformaticians working throughout the EMBL community. It provides information on relevant events, computational services, and expertise. We are keenly interested in expanding the scope of our computational and experimental models to gain mechanistic insight into the following biological processes: i) xenobiotic metabolism in microbial communities; ii) crosstalk between metabolism and gene regulatory networks; and iii) metabolic changes during developmental processes. To this end, we are actively seeking collaborative projects within EMBL and elsewhere.

 Surface view of a Drosophila embryo at the onset of gastrulation. A pulse of laser light has been used to trigger the translocation of an actin inhibitor to the plasma membrane in a central stripe of cells. Optogentically activated cells lose their regular hexagonal shape and will fail to gastrulate. Image is pseudo-coloured according to fluorescence intensity (blue=low/yellow=high). See also Movie 1.   Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Confocal movie of an embryo at the onset of gastrulation (surface view). Using a pulse of two-photon laser (red box), an inhibitor of actin polymerisation was recruited to the plasma membrane in a central stripe of cells. Activated cells cannot contract and are pulled by neighbouring non-activated contracting cells. Cell shape changes are of fundamental importance during embryonic development. How cells form and change shape during morphogenesis are the key questions addressed by the De Renzis group. Tissue morphogenesis is triggered by shape changes in single cells or group of cells. This remodelling depends on a complex interaction between cortical forces exerted by the actin cytoskeleton and membrane homeostasis (i.e. vesicular trafficking and lipid metabolism). Using the early Drosophila embryo as model organism, we wish to understand how membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics are regulated during morphogenesis and how this, in turn, impacts on specific cell and tissue behaviour. We have recently developed new optogenetic methods to manipulate key components of the membrane transport machinery and cytoskeletal regulators with cellular precision in situ during embryonic development (Figure 1). Using these novel tools in combination with two-photon microscopy we can now control protein function with high-spatio temporal precision and thus functionally link subcellular to supracellular processes during morphogenesis. We are also implementing optogenetics to study signalling systems and induce tissue-specific differentiation programmes at will. Using a combination of imaging, genome engineering, optogenetic, and biochemical approaches, we wish to elucidate how machineries controlling intracellular trafficking re-organise during differentiation and how this in turn impacts on global changes in tissue morphology. One long-term goal of the group will be to reconstitute morphogenetic processes in na\xefve tissues using synthetic approaches.

Figure 2: The CAST approach providing insights into determinants of chromothripsis. The Korbel group combines experimental and computational approaches to decipher determinants and consequences of germline and somatic DNA variation. Genetic variation is a fundamental reason why humans differ from one another and why some individuals are more susceptible to diseases than others. Our group is investigating mechanisms and the phenotypic consequences of genetic variation, with a focus on genomic structural variations (SVs). Genome-wide techniques we employ include genome sequencing, single cell and epigenomic assays (including ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq, and Hi-C). Our laboratory uses a \u2018hybrid\u2019 approach (integrating laboratory and computational methodology) to combine data generation and analysis with hypothesis generation and experimental testing. Computational methodologies range from analytical integration approaches (with the purpose to uncover biological novelty) to statistically-oriented methods development. Our group plays leadership roles in research consortia, including currently the largest ongoing global \u201cbig data\u201d initiative \u2013 the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project. Integrating data from somatic and germline whole genomes, DNA methylomes, transcriptomes, and clinical data from more than 2800 cancer patients, we aim to unravel commonalities and discrepancies between the emergence of cancer types and subtypes at the molecular level, to facilitate the molecular classification of malignancies with impact on diagnostics and treatment, and to uncover causalities linking genotype, environment, and phenotype. Within the 1000 Genomes Project and its follow-up studies, we are conducting further human deep population surveys using short-read and single-molecule long DNA read sequencing. Recent work by us uncovered the most comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation to date, providing insights into the origin of diverse structural variation classes (Figure 1). We are also making progress in understanding the occurrence of complex genetic variants with experimental model systems, especially with regard to a process known as chromothripsis \u2013 a cellular catastrophe causing massive simultaneous DNA rearrangements. We recently developed an integrative method termed \u2018Complex Alterations after Selection and Transformation\u2019 (CAST) allowing mechanistic dissection of chromothripsis (Figure 2). CAST revealed an increased rate of chromothripsis in hyperploid cells and following telomere shortening (through siRNA induced silencing of a shelterin complex component), findings that we verified by genome sequencing in primary brain tumours.

Figure 2: Molecular heterogeneity during mouse blastocyst patterning. Cells expressing Nanog (green), Gata6 (red) or Serpinh1 (blue). The Hiiragi group studies early mammalian development at the molecular, cellular and systems levels to elucidate how an intricate embryo emerges from a spherical mass of cells. A defining feature of multi-cellular living systems is the capacity to break symmetry and generate well-defined forms and patterns through self-organisation. Our group aims to understand the design principle of multi-cellular self-organisation, using a well-suited model system: early mouse embryos. Mammalian eggs lack polarity and thus symmetry is broken during early embryogenesis (figure 1). This symmetry breaking results in the formation of a blastocyst consisting of two major cell types, the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm, each distinct in its position and gene expression profile. Recent studies unexpectedly revealed that morphogenesis and gene expression are highly dynamic and stochastically variable during this process (figure 2). Determining which signal breaks the initial symmetry and how the blastocyst establishes a remarkably reproducible shape and pattern despite the preceding variability remain fundamental open questions about the beginning of mammalian life (Wennekamp et al. 2013). Our recent studies led us to the working hypothesis that feedback interactions between cell and tissue mechanics (contractility, adhesion, geometry and pressure), cell polarity and cell fate may be central components of multi-cellular self-organisation (Maitre et al. 2016). We aim to understand how molecular, cellular and physical signals are dynamically coupled across the scales for self-organisation during early mammalian development. To this end, we have developed a unique set of experimental frameworks that integrate biology and physics. Firstly, we apply advanced live-embryo imaging and comprehensive lineage mapping to monitor early embryogenesis at unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution (Dietrich, Panavaite et al. 2015; Strnad et al. 2016). Secondly, we design and utilise reduced experimental systems to decouple and measure interdependent parameters acting on developing embryos and build physical models (Maitre et al. 2015; Maitre et al. 2016). Thirdly, we use genetics, biophysics and micromanipulation to spatio-temporally control the system and test predictions of our models (Maitre et al. 2016). Using early mammalian embryos we aim to set a paradigm for studying self-organisation across subcellular, cellular and whole organismal scales. We adopt a wide variety of experimental strategies including embryology, genetics, advanced microscopy, biophysics and theoretical modelling in order to address fundamental questions in development and cell biology at molecular, cellular and systems levels.

### Anne Ephrussi
 Figure 1: Confocal (upper half) and super-resolution (STED, lower half) micrograph of localising oskar mRNPs in close proximity to the posterior pole of a developing Drosophila oocyte. oskar mRNPs are labeled with a an array of 37 short single stranded DNA oligonucleotides complementary to oskar mRNA, each labeled with a single Atto-Rho14 fluorescent dye (images courtesy of Imre Gaspar).  Figure 2: An mRNA biosensor (TRICK) for oskar mRNA visualises the first round of oskar-TRICK translation in Drosophila oocytes. In early-stage oocytes oskar-TRICK mRNA is labeled by both NLS-PCP-GFP (green) and NLS-MCP-RFP (red), fluorescent RNA-binding proteins, indicating translational repression. In later stages, the NLS-PCP-GFP fluorescent signal is reduced at the posterior pole and Oskar protein (blue) is detected by immunofluorescence, consistent with translation of a portion of the transcripts (see Halstead*, Lionnet*, Wilbertz*, Wippich* et al., Science 2015). The Ephrussi group dissects the mechanisms that underlie intracellular RNA transport and localised translation \u2013 fundamental processes that mediate the functional polarisation of cells during development and in the nervous system. Post-transcriptional RNA regulation is central to organismal development and function. The combination of intracellular mRNA localisation and localised translation is a powerful strategy that allows quick and local deployment of protein activities in cells in response to extrinsic signals. mRNA localisation is widespread and conserved from yeast to man. It is involved in the establishment of cell asymmetry, is particularly evident in large cells, such as eggs and neurons, and has key roles in cell fate decisions, cell migration, cell morphology, and polarised cell functions. Asymmetric RNA localisation can be achieved by different mechanisms, such as active transport of RNAs by motor proteins moving on cytoskeletal elements, local protection of RNAs from degradation, facilitated diffusion and trapping. In the large Drosophila melanogaster oocyte, asymmetrically localised cell fate determinants specify the body axes and pattern the future embryo and fly, making it an ideal model for the study of RNA localisation. During oogenesis, the embryonic axis determinant-encoding oskar, bicoid and gurken mRNAs are transported to specific sites within the oocyte, where they are anchored and locally translated, thus ensuring spatial restriction of their protein products. A polarised cytoskeleton and specific motor proteins mediate mRNA transport and anchoring within the oocyte. Our research combines live-imaging, super-resolution microscopy, genetics and biochemistry to understand how mRNAs are transported, anchored and locally translated. Of particular interest is oskar mRNA, which encodes Oskar protein, which is endowed with the unique ability to induce the formation of germ cells, the cells that ensure perpetuation of the species. oskar mRNA is transported to the posterior pole of the oocyte, where it is translated. Oskar protein, which contains LOTUS and SGNH-hydolase-like domains, nucleates formation of germ granules, RNP complexes containing RNAs and proteins essential for germ cell formation and function. Taking a structure-function approach that combines structural biology, genetics, proteomics and transcriptomics, we are addressing how germ granules form and function. Other classes of RNAs also have important developmental functions. We are investigating the roles of long non-coding RNAs, piRNAs, and of non-canonical RNA binding proteins in Drosophila development. With its exceptional genetic tools, Drosophila is ideally suited for investigation of the fundamental mechanisms that govern animal development. We combine genetics, biochemistry and a broad spectrum of cell biological and imaging approaches to study:

### John Briggs
 Figure 1: Correlated fluorescence and electron microscopy can be used to locate a defined intermediate stage in endocytosis and extract quantitative information. This can be applied to multiple stages to understand the whole process (Kukulski et al. 2012).  Figure 2: 3D reconstructions of COPI coated vesicles obtained using cryo-electron tomography and sub-tomogram averaging (Faini et al. 2012) We study the structure and the molecular assembly mechanisms of important, pathogenic, enveloped viruses (e.g. HIV and Influenza virus), and of cellular trafficking vesicles (e.g. clathrin and COPI coated vesicles). Viruses and vesicles are extraordinary self-assembling machines \u2013 the protein building blocks interact with one another to bring all the components or cargo together, to reshape the lipid bilayer, and to release a free virus or vesicle. The building blocks will often then undergo an intricate reassembly to prepare for fusion with a target cell or membrane. The level of understanding we aim to achieve could be imagined as a 3D, functionally annotated movie, with molecular resolution, showing the assembly and budding process. To reach this goal we need to obtain detailed structural information at different stages during assembly, ideally under close-to-native conditions, even within cells. This is a challenge for conventional structural biology tools, so we are also developing and applying new approaches for cryo-electron microscopy and tomography, correlated fluorescence and electron microscopy, and image processing. Members of the group have varied and complementary skills, including biochemistry, cell biology, physics, engineering and computer sciences. A particular emphasis of our research is the structure and lifecycle of asymmetric membrane viruses such as HIV. Recently we were able to use cryo-tomography methods optimised in the lab to determine the structure of the immature HIV-1 capsid within heterogeneous HIV virus particles. Further details on our research into the structure and inhibition of HIV are available on our Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit webpage. We are also studying the structure and assembly of influenza virus. We are studying the assembly mechanisms of coated vesicles both within cells, and using in-vitro reconstituted budding reactions. By applying correlative fluorescence and electron microscopy we are able to image defined intermediates during budding in cells. Using in vitro systems we are able to get detailed structural information on the arrangement of the coat proteins in the assembled vesicles. Together these methods are giving us important insights into how the clathrin and COPI machineries mediate vesicle formation. How can we get detailed 3D structural information about variable membrane-containing systems such as influenza, HIV, or a COPI coated vesicle? These kinds of samples cannot be crystallised or studied using single particle cryo-electron microscopy methods. Instead we have been applying and further developing a combination of cryo-electron tomography and image processing by sub-tomogram averaging. We were recently able to show for the first time that this approach can resolve individual alpha-helices within proteins in heterogeneous systems. We are now applying these developments to a number of projects (see above). We make use of the world class facilities for cryo-electron microscopy at EMBL, and interact closely with companies to assess and apply new technologies. How can we find and image dynamic intermediate timepoints during vesicle budding within cells? We have developed correlative fluorescence and electron microscopy methods that allow fluorescent signals from transient intermediates to be localised at <100 nm precision within cells and imaged in 3D by cryo-electron tomography. As part of this work, we have interacted with a commercial company to design and build a new cryo-fluorescence microscopy stage. Our overarching biological goal is to understand the interplay between protein complexes, membrane shape and virus/vesicle structure. What kind of protein-protein interactions can drive virus assembly while maintaining structural flexibility? How do structural switches allow viruses and vesicles that have completed the assembly pathway to start disassembling? How do proteins induce the distortion of cellular membranes into vesicles of different dimensions? What are the similarities and differences between the variety of cellular budding events? How do viruses hijack cellular systems for their own use? How does the curvature of a membrane influence its interaction with particular proteins? We will also aim to generate detailed and specific information on the mechanism of HIV and influenza virus assembly. Our technical goal is to develop novel microscopy and image processing approaches that can be used to address these questions, but which can also be widely applied by other research labs. Bioinformatics at EMBL \n\n Figure 3: An optimised combination of cryo-electron tomography and image processing, developed in the lab, allowed the structure of the immature HIV-1 capsid to be resolved in situ \u2013 within heterogeneous virus particles.

### Kyung-Min Noh
 Figure 1:\xa0Top: biological system of interest, middle: concept of epigenetic mechanisms, bottom: example of genome-wide approaches with wild-type and mutant epigenetic regulator. The Noh group studies chromatin links vital for neurodevelopment and brain disorders. Chromatin, the faithful association of DNA with histone proteins, exists as the physiological form of our genome and the substrate for processes that regulate cellular gene expression. Numerous diseases including neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with mutations in genes that encode for chromatin-binding proteins or chromatin-modifying enzymes, which together act as epigenetic regulators. A central question grounding our research is how the normal/mutated epigenetic regulators engage in brain development, function and disease. Histone variants and covalent modifications of both DNA and histones act in concert to define the landscape of our epigenome. Previously, we explored the interconnections between histone and DNA modifications by focusing on a conserved chromatin-binding regulatory domain, the ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L (ADD) domain. We showed that the ADD domain is capable of sensing, and therefore integrating, the status of multiple histone modifications. This in turn dictates the in vivo localisation of the full-length ADD-containing protein and its ability to function in downstream chromatin remodelling events. In parallel, we uncovered the localisation and function of a histone H3 variant, H3.3. Guided by distinct chaperone systems, H3.3 marks the genomic regions of histone turnover. We mapped the genome-wide localisation of H3.3 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and neuronal precursor cells, and further expanded to terminally differentiated neurons for studying its functional role in promoting neuronal plasticity. We aim to study chromatin regulation, its interpretation during brain development, and its misinterpretation in relation with brain cognitive and developmental disorders. We will focus on the molecular mechanisms that link genetic mutations encoded in epigenetic regulators to the widespread chromatin alterations. To model developmental stages and facilitate the necessary genome editing/engineering, we will use differentiating neurons from mESCs and human induced pluripotent cells (hiPSCs). Defining the \u2018epigenetic landscape\u2019 \u2013 both in normal and abnormal brain cells \u2013 will help provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention for cognitive and neurodevelopmental disorders.

### Lars Steinmetz
 Figure 1: Gene-environment interactions reveal causal pathways (A-B) that mediate genetic effects on phenotype (Gagneur et al., PLOS Genetics 2013)   Figure 2: Dying mRNA tells a story of its life: Co-translational degradation revealed by 5P-Seq, a novel method that profiles ribosome dynamics (Pelechano et al., Cell 2015) \xa0 The Steinmetz group develops and applies interdisciplinary, genome-wide technologies to study genome regulation, the genetic basis of complex phenotypes and the genetic and molecular systems underpinning disease. One of the most daunting obstacles in biomedicine is the complex nature of most phenotypes (including cancer, diabetes, heart disease and some rare diseases) due to interactions between multiple genetic variants and environmental influences. A central challenge is to understand how genetic and environmental perturbations affect health, wellness and disease. Our research is directed at understanding such complex traits. To do so, we develop novel genomic approaches to study the molecular processes that link genotype to phenotype, identify the causal underlying factors, and quantify their contributions. We investigate inter-individual variation at the level of the genome, transcriptome, and proteome, which we integrate with higher-level phenotypes. Our projects are mainly in the following areas: Quantitative genetics:\xa0We have piloted new technologies to dissect the genetic and environmental interactions that underlie complex, multifactorial phenotypes. We are interested in studying the consequences of genetic variation, learning to predict phenotype from genotype, and integrating multiple layers of molecular data to define intervention points that can be targeted to modulate phenotypes of interest (figure 1). Functions and mechanisms of gene regulation:\xa0We have developed several technologies to characterise and quantify transcriptome architecture as well as its functional impact. In particular, we are interested in the function and regulation of non-coding RNAs, antisense transcription, transcriptional heterogeneity, and the molecular phenotypes that arise from pervasive transcription. Recently, we discovered that translation and degradation occur in parallel on the same mRNA allowing ribosome movement to be captured (figure 2). Disease models: Using multiple model systems, primarily yeast and human cells, we have characterised the genetic and cellular processes affected in certain diseases and assessed potential therapeutic strategies. We apply personalised functional genomics to study diseases in patient-derived cells using systematic and targeted approaches to unravel mechanisms and discover novel treatments (see video). We also develop point-of-care biosensors that monitor an individual\u2019s health and facilitate early disease diagnosis and intervention, even before symptoms set in. Recent scientific presentations:2016 International Symposium on Emerging Technologies, Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle: "Biosensors for personal molecular monitoring of health and disease" Using novel algorithms, we aim to identify causal intervention points from multi-omic datasets to modulate phenotypes of interest, including those associated with diseases. We are expanding our studies of transcriptional regulation through targeted investigations of the functional consequences of complex transcriptome architecture and its contributions to single-cell heterogeneity. Ultimately, by integrating genome technologies, biomedical engineering and computational modelling, we aim to uncover the molecular features of health and enable personalised and preventative medicine. Our lab operates in an integrated manner across sites in Heidelberg, Germany, and at Stanford University in the US. Find out more about the European Research Council

### Carsten Schultz
 Figure 1:\xa0Several reporter and modulator molecules have been developed in our lab, including: small molecule sensors for lipases and proteases; genetically encoded reporters for kinase and phosphatase activities; membranepermeant and photoactivatable lipid molecules; and lipid derivatives that can be fluorescently labelled in living cells. The Schultz group develops tools for imaging and for manipulating cellular enzyme activities, with a particular emphasis on lipid signalling in diabetes and the hereditary disease cystic fibrosis. Past projects: Our research has previously focused on finding novel ways to stimulate chloride and water secretion of epithelial cells in understanding cystic fibrosis (CF). Our compounds helped to investigate some of the underlying intracellular signalling pathways and provided drug candidates to eventually treat CF patients. Of particular significance was the development of chemical methods to convert highly polar signalling molecules like cyclic nucleotides, inositol phosphates, and phosphoinositides to membrane-permeant, bioactivatable derivatives (\u2018prodrugs\u2019) (Schultz 2003; Laketa et al. 2009, Laketa et al. 2014). Current projects: Our interest in CF has shifted to the development of lung emphysema \u2013 the ultimate cause of death in the patient. In a truly translational collaboration with the Mall group (MMPU), we develop FRET reporters to sense enzyme activities detrimental to lung tissue, such as macrophage and neutrophil elastases. At the cell biology level, our interest focuses on signalling networks regulated by G-protein-coupled and growth factor receptors. We developed a wide range of fluorescent reporter molecules, either genetically encoded (Pilji\u0107 & Schultz, 2011) or as small molecule fluorescent probes (see figure). We hope to provide a more complete picture of the signalling network and to help find compounds beneficial in unravelling basic principles in signal transduction and, ultimately, in ion and enzyme secretion relevant to CF patients or in insulin secretion of s-cells. In addition, we prepared a large number of tools to manipulate signalling networks and are able to locally activate the important messenger such as PIP3 and DAG with a light flash in subcellular resolution in living cells (Mentel et al. 2011; Nadler et al. 2013, Nadler et al. submitted). In order to specifically label molecules with fluorophores in intact cells, we prepare highly stable unnatural amino acids that rapidly and irreversibly undergo cycloaddition reactions (click chemistry) with unsurpassed speed and study their application in collaboration with the Lemke group. Hot projects: Currently, we are very excited about making highly charged dyes pass cell membranes. In collaboration with the H\xe4ring group, we are developing a method to visualise protein-protein interactions in cells in real time. By using a novel set of photoactivatable lipid molecules, we are able to modulate the signalling underlying insulin secretion, likely to provide new means of identifying targets important in diabetes. We will continue work aimed at bringing fluorescent reporters for enzyme activities closer to the clinic. We will also focus on lipid signalling and lipid-controlled cell biology, and examine the effect of sphingo- and phospholipids on endocytosis, lipid trafficking, and insulin secretion. In addition, we will improve our possibilities to fluorescently label molecules in intact cells by using faster and more complete bioorthogonal reactions and new fluorophores. Most projects rely on organic chemistry and the group has a significant number of preparative chemists at the graduate student and postdoc level. The symbiosis of chemistry, biochemistry, and cell biology opens new doors and grants novel insights into how cells exhibit their function.

### Lars Hufnagel
 Figure 1: MuVi-SPIM image of a Drosophila embryo. Eight views were fused to yield an in toto reconstruction of the embryo (one side membrane unrolled). The high speed of the microscope enables a detailed reconstruction of cell lineage and shape changes over extended periods of development. The Hufnagel group studies the role of mechanical constraints on processes such as cell growth, programmed cell death, orientation of division, intratissue rearrangements and cell differentiation. Biological processes are highly dynamic and span many temporal and spatial scales. During development, cells must integrate and respond to a multitude of biochemical and biophysical signals: for example, changes in intracellular signalling networks, cytoskeleton remodelling, cell shape changes, long-range signalling and tissue remodelling. A whole-embryo view of morphogenesis with subcellular resolution is essential for unravelling the interconnected dynamics at varying scales of development \u2013 from interactions within cells to those acting across the whole embryo. Bridging scales from the submicron to the millimetre range with a temporal resolution of several seconds \u2013 combined with a total imaging time of several hours \u2013 not only poses tremendous challenges for modern microscopy methods but also requires powerful computational approaches for data handling, processing, and image analysis. The central question that we are interested in is how a complex multi-cellular tissue or organism is formed from individual cells by spatio-temporal regulation of biophysical and intracellular signalling processes. We address all experimental steps, from innovative transgenic lines and microscope development to systematic image processing and biophysical modelling. This requires a multidisciplinary environment of biologists, physicists and computer scientists working closely together. In order to address these questions we develop novel imaging techniques based on selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM). SPIM yields optical sectioning by uncoupling the optical path for sample illumination from emitted photon detection. The illumination branch creates a thin light sheet to illuminate a specimen from the side and the emitted light is collected and imaged onto a high speed and high sensitivity camera by a second objective lens. The unprecedented speed of light sheet-based microscopy poses challenges for data handling and image processing, which we address by developing novel image processing tools. Currently, we investigate cell shape changes and growth patterns in the Drosophila embryo with emphasis on the role of mechanical constraints on organ formation and tissue differentiation, complemented by mammalian cell culture studies investigating cell cycle response of an epithelial tissue to external and internal mechanical perturbations. Our group is part of the Centre for Modelling and Simulations in the Biosciences (BIOMS). We are focused on the control and regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis and cellular rearrangement processes in developing tissues, with a specific emphasis on epithelial tissues and the role of mechanical interactions as a regulator. We seek to characterise and quantify the spatio-temporal effects of mechanical stress, deformations and fluid flow-induced sheer stress on cell growth, gene expression and cellular polarity in two-dimensional epithelial tissues. To address this issue, we pursue an interdisciplinary approach combining classical biological techniques with detailed modelling methods from various fields, ranging from statistical physics to applied mathematics and computer science. We will continue to not only tailor light-sheet microscopes to match specific biological questions, but also push the boundaries of light-sheet microscopy towards high speed intracellular imaging with extremely thin light sheets, super-resolution techniques, and quantitative in toto imaging.

### Mikhail Savitski
The Savitski team uses and develops stability proteomics for understanding the phenomenon of aggregation and disaggregation, cell phenotyping, and detection of protein interactions with drugs, metabolites, DNA and RNA. The rapid evolution of high-end mass spectrometers in recent years has enabled an in depth quantitative assessment of the proteome. This development combined with recent advancements in multiplexing technologies (Werner et al. Analytical Chemistry 2012 & 2014), enables new lines of scientific research aimed at proteome wide understanding of the state and function of proteins. It has been known since 1959 that enzymes become more thermostable when bound to their ligand. In 2013 it was demonstrated for the first time for a handful of proteins that this could enable detection of drug protein interactions in living cells, by heating the cells to different temperatures spinning down the unfolded and subsequently aggregated proteins and measuring the amount of the soluble protein at different temperatures thus inferring its melting curve (Martinez Molina et al. Science 2013). More recently my former colleagues and I extended this methodology to monitoring the thermal stability of thousands of proteins in an unbiased way using multiplexed quantitative mass spectrometry, Figure 1, (Savitski et al. Science 2014). This new proteomics method, which we termed Thermal Proteome Profiling (TPP), enables identification of drug targets in situ on a proteome wide scale. We also realized that protein components of pathways affected by the drugs underwent changes in thermal stability. Moreover, comparison of cell lines with different constitutively activated pathways revealed differences in thermal stability of pathway components confirming that TPP can be used as a complementary approach to e.g. phospho proteomics to study signaling in cells. It was also observed that disruption of protein-protein interactions had an effect on thermal stability. The TPP technology thus holds a big promise for becoming a powerful tool for fundamental biology studies. At the same time the technology still needs to be significantly further developed with regard to experimental strategies and data analysis. Below the key points for improvement and application of the technology are outlined, which will be the focus of the lab.

### Janosch Hennig
 Figure 1: An example of cooperative, highly specific RNA recognition by two general but distinct RNA binding proteins, Sex-lethal and UNR, regulating the translation of msl-2 mRNA during Drosophila dosage compensation (Hennig et al., 2014).  Figure 2: Different modes of RNA binding by RNA binding proteins, where single RBDs, having low specificity can bind to multiple sites on the mRNA transcript (a). Affinity and specificity increases upon cooperative binding of multiple RBDs within a single RBP (b), conformational selection or fly-casting (c), or cooperative interaction between multiple but distinct RBPs. The Hennig group employs integrated structural biology, combining nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and small-angle scattering together with other biophysical techniques to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying translation regulation with a special focus on multi-protein-RNA assemblies and the tripartite motif protein family. Recognition of mRNA by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) plays essential roles during all stages of gene expression, including splicing, translation, degradation and transport. Also, biogenesis of non-coding RNAs depends on RNA-protein interactions. It is not yet understood in a spatial and temporal manner, how RBPs specify for their cognate RNA sequences on untranslated regions (UTRs). Single RBPs have often a low sequence specificity, especially if they feature only one RNA binding domain. Specificity and affinity increases if RBPs harbour more RNA binding domains. Recently, we have shown that multiple but distinct RBPs act cooperatively to specify for their right target RNA (Figure 1), adding another recognition mechanism to the list of demonstrated protein-RNA interactions (Figure 2). The atlas of RBPs has been extended to protein domains so far not known to bind RNAs. One of them, the NHL repeat domain, is featured in several members of the eukaryotic tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family. Members of this family featuring this domain are intricately involved in stem and progenitor cell development via interaction with the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) and are associated to different types of cancer. Biochemically, TRIM proteins are known to act as E3 ligases within ubiquitin signalling. Our research aims to understand the link between ubiquitylation and mRNA translation/degradation mediated by this multi-domain protein family in a structural and functional way. Due to the intrinsically flexible regions in multi-domain proteins and transient protein-protein interactions with other RBPs and proteins of the ubiquitin system, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is well-suited to study TRIM proteins and protein-RNA interactions. However, the size limitations of NMR are disadvantageous, making it necessary to combine sparse NMR data with small-angle scattering and X-ray crystallography. Our future efforts will focus on TRIM proteins and other protein-RNA regulatory networks and will encompass the following main tasks and goals:

### Toby Gibson
\n\n Figure 1: Schematic of cumulative and sequential regulatory switches involving linear motif interactions (see Van Roey et al., 2012) The Gibson team investigates protein sequences and interactions, undertakes computational analyses of macromolecules, and develops tools to enhance sequence analysis research. Regulatory decisions during eukaryotic cell signalling are made within large dynamic protein complexes by in-complex molecular switching (see Van Roey et al., 2014). Cell regulation is networked, redundant and, above all, cooperative: the proteins involved make remarkable numbers of interactions, and thus have highly modular architectures (Tompa et al., 2014). Tight spatial and temporal regulation goes against the traditional but misleading \u2018kinase cascade\u2019 metaphor. We host the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource dedicated to short functional site motifs in modular protein sequences, as well as switches.ELM, a compendium of motif-based molecular switches. Linear motifs (LMs or SLiMs) are short functional sites used for the dynamic assembly and regulation of large cellular protein complexes: their characterisation is essential to understand cell signalling. \u2018Hub\u2019 proteins, that make many contacts in interaction networks, have abundant LMs in large Intrinsically Unstructured Protein segments (IUP). Viral proteomes are rich in LMs that are used to hijack cell systems required for viral production. ELM data is now being used by many bioinformatics groups to develop and benchmark LM predictors. We are now actively hunting for new LM candidates and we look to collaborate with groups undertaking validation experiments \u2013 see, for example, the recent interdisciplinary collaboration on the ABBA cell cycle regulatory motif (Di Fiore et al., 2015). We also undertake more general computational analyses of biological macromolecules. Where possible, we contribute to multidisciplinary projects involving structural and experimental groups at EMBL and elsewhere.  \n\n Figure 2: Linear motifs in T cell signalling, colour-coded by functional class (see Gibson et al., 2015). We will continue to hunt for regulatory motifs and undertake proteome surveys to answer specific questions. Protein interaction networks are anticipated to become increasingly important to our work. Due to the tight integration of protein and RNA molecules in cell regulation, we have a growing transcriptomics focus. We seek to take protein architecture tools, such as \u2018switches.ELM\u2019, to a new level of power and applicability to investigate modular protein function and, in the future, the proteome and protein networks in general. We aim to improve how bioinformatics standards represent cooperative molecular interactions. As part of the EU consortia SyBoSS and SYSCILIA we have been looking at interaction networks and systems in stem cells and in primary cilia. The team provides in-house advice, help and training for biological sequence analysis. It is a good idea to try and develop an understanding of the nature of the macromolecules that you are experimenting on. While of course this will always be imperfectly achieved, it may be possible to find out enough in advance of doing experimentation to forestall certain experimental errors or to design a better experiment given what is knowable. Common errors, such as ending a deletion construct half way through a globular domain or mutating a buried hydrophobic residue - both of which produce unfolding and misfunctional constructs, can usually be avoided by some thought in advance. Comparative analysis of multiple sequence alignments is indispensable when considering structure/function relationships, identifying functional residues etc. Multiple alignments are also useful when distant relationships are being sought, as they provide the raw material for HMM searches. On occasion, it may be worth constructing a robust phylogeny of a protein family, for example when change of function in the subtrees is suspected. Much research within EMBL involves highly modular eukaryotic regulatory proteins and since these are our speciality, we are always keen to scrutinise them: we won't always find something interesting, but if we look at enough, somebody will get lucky. If your work involves biological sequences and you think you might benefit from what we can do then come and talk to a team member, perhaps the one you know best already or else Aidan Budd or Toby Gibson. \xa0 We also contribute to EMBL's Bio-IT community and the development of the communities internal EMBL Bio-IT portal. This resource aims to help network and facilitate the work of bioinformaticians working throughout the EMBL community. It provides information on relevant events, computational services, and expertise.

### Martin Jechlinger
The Jechlinger group uses a 3D culture system of primary mouse mammary epithelial cells to study cancer-initiating oncogenes. In patients and mouse models, interference with the activity of cancer-initiating oncogenes can result in tumour regression. However, novel therapies that target the products of mutant alleles in human cancers are only partly successful, since maintenance of remission requires long-term treatment and relapse often occurs in the presence of therapeutic agents. Hence, a better understanding of drug resistance and tumour recurrence is needed for the design of more successful anti-cancer strategies. Transgenic mice carrying regulatable transgenes represent tractable systems for studying the mechanisms of oncogene dependence, the response and resistance to targeted drugs and tumour recurrence. In a complementary approach, we have developed a 3D culture system of primary mouse mammary epithelial cells to study detailed responses to the induction and de-induction of oncogenes (mimicking treatment with an ideally targeted drug). This 3D system produced phenotypic changes similar to those observed in the mammary glands of the transgenic mice from which the cultures were derived. In addition, this new approach identified and isolated cells that had survived oncogene withdrawal, which represent a pure population of residual \u2018dormant\u2019 tumour cells. We recently verified that these residual cells progress to form recurrent tumours similar to relapses observed in the animals and reminiscent of the patient situation.

### Francesca Peri
 Microglia (green) and neurons (red) in the zebrafish embryonic brain. The Peri group combines genetic approaches with quantitative imaging techniques to study interactions between neurons and the microglia that eliminate cellular debris in the brain. During brain development, neurons are generated in great excess and only those that make functional connections survive, while the majority is eliminated via apoptosis. Such huge numbers of dying cells pose a problem to the embryo, as leaking cell contents damages the surrounding environment. Therefore, the clearance of dying cells must be fast and efficient and is performed by a resident lineage of \u2018professional\u2019 phagocytes, the microglia. These cells patrol the entire vertebrate brain and sense the presence of apoptotic and damaged neurons. The coupling between the death of neurons and their phagocytosis by microglia is striking; every time we observe dead neurons we find them already inside the microglia. This remarkable correlation suggests a fast acting communication between the two cell types, such that microglia are forewarned of the coming problem and may even promote the controlled death of neurons during brain development. Despite the importance of microglia in several neuronal pathologies, the mechanism underlying their degradation of neurons remains elusive. The zebrafish Danio rerio is an ideal model system to study complex cell-cell interactions in vivo. As the embryo is optically transparent, the role of molecular regulators identified in large-scale forward and reverse genetic screens can be studied in vivo. Moreover, a key advantage of the system is that zebrafish microglia are extremely large, dynamic cells that form a non-overlapping network within the small transparent fish brain. Labelling microglia, neurons and organelles of the microglial phagocytotic pathway simultaneously in the living zebrafish embryos allows us to image, for the first time, the entire microglial population in order to study the interaction between neurons and microglia. How microglia collectively ensure that the entire brain is surveyed and how they react to damage with high precision is still entirely unknown. Recent findings suggest that diffusible molecules such as lipids and nucleotides could attract microglia in response to neuronal apoptosis and injury, respectively. While these molecules can trigger dynamic changes in microglia motility in vitro, elucidating how their activity is controlled within the intact brain, both in space and time, remains the most important challenge in understanding this fascinating biological problem. We aim to further exploit the massive imaging potential of the transparent zebrafish embryo for studying microglial biology in vivo. By combining forward and reverse genetic approaches with quantitative imaging technology, we will directly address the mechanisms underlying the attraction of microglia towards apoptotic, sick and injured neurons. By applying cutting-edge microscopy technology, such as the SPIM/DSLM (Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy), we will image all interactions between neurons and microglia and derive from this time-lapse analysis real quantitative data in a spatiotemporal manner.

 Figure 1: The actin filament network (gray) embedding the chromosomes (red).  Figure 2: Transparent starfish oocytes are uniquely suited for imaging meiotic divisions. Using starfish as a model organism, the L\xe9n\xe1rt group combines biochemistry with imaging assays to investigate how the fertilisable egg cell develops from the oocyte. All animal life begins with the fusion of sperm and egg. Our research is focused on the egg cell, specifically investigating how the fertilisable egg develops from the oocyte through meiotic divisions. Oocytes are exceptionally large cells, with diameters up to millimetres in size, because they store large amounts of nutrients to support embryonic development. Therefore, in oocytes and eggs, the cytoskeleton has to transport organelles, separate chromosomes, and organise cellular architecture in a very large cytoplasm. How the cytoskeleton adapts to this unusual size, and how these mechanisms differ from those in small somatic cells, is largely unknown. We use starfish oocytes as a model system because they are easy to handle, complete meiosis rapidly, develop simply in seawater at room temperature, and are transparent \u2013 ideal for high-resolution imaging of cytoskeletal dynamics in live cells. We use confocal microscopy to image live starfish oocytes and employ computational image analysis tools to extract quantitative parameters from these 3D time-lapse datasets. Parameters such as local concentrations or velocities of cellular components provide a quantitative assay for the biological process and, at the same time, serve as inputs for computational models of cytoskeletal dynamics. Model predictions are then tested in perturbation experiments using physical or molecular manipulations. Biochemistry, in combination with the imaging assays, is used to identify the key molecular components in the process. We have recently shown that meiotic chromosomes scattered in the large oocyte nucleus are collected by an actin meshwork and transported to the spindle, whose short microtubules cannot reach the chromosomes directly, as they do in somatic cells. This novel actin-based chromosome transport system forms as the nuclear envelope breaks down and fills the nuclear space with an actin meshwork, physically entrapping chromosomes. We showed that the actin meshwork contracts homogeneously; however, because it is mechanically anchored to the cell cortex, this contraction is translated into directional transport towards the cortex where the spindle forms. By understanding the mechanism of chromosome transport essential to oocyte division and fertility, our studies revealed a novel design principle for a cytoskeletal \u2018transport machine\u2019 that is very different from previously known mechanisms of actin-driven intracellular transport. Immediate goals include determining the detailed structure of the F-actin meshwork, understanding the molecular mechanisms of meshwork contraction, and identifying the mechanisms by which chromosomes attach to the meshwork. We will employ highresolution imaging methods to resolve single actin-filaments and to identify, localise and perturb molecules regulating actin filament dynamics to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Longer term, we are interested in related cytoskeletal processes that occur in oocytes, eggs and early embryos, with the aim of understanding mechanistically the organisational principles of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton.

 Figure 1: Automated multivariate phenotyping of cells by combinatorial RNAi and automated image analysis. The Huber group develops large-scale statistical models that integrate genomic, molecular and phenotypic data to understand the variations between individuals in health and disease. A central challenge of biomedicine is to understand how the biological systems that underlie healthy life and disease react to variations in their make-up (genetic variation, for example) or their environment (drugs, for example). Our group brings together researchers from quantitative disciplines \u2013 mathematics, statistics, physics and computer science \u2013 and from different fields of biology and medicine. We employ statistics and machine learning to discover patterns in large datasets, understand mechanisms, and act upon predictive and causal relationships to, ultimately, address questions in personal genomics and molecular medicine. More specifically, we use large-scale data acquisition and quantitative modelling of phenotypes and molecular profiles, systematic perturbations (such as drugs or high-throughput genetics) and computational analysis of non-linear, epistatic interaction networks. Genomics and other molecular profiling technologies have resulted in increasingly detailed biology-based understanding of human disease. The next challenge is using this knowledge to engineer treatments and cures. We integrate observational data \u2013 such as from large-scale sequencing and molecular profiling \u2013, with interventional data \u2013 systematic genetic or chemical screens \u2013 to reconstruct a fuller picture of the underlying causal relationships and actionable intervention points. A fascinating example is our work on genotype-specific vulnerability and resistance of tumours to targeted drugs in our precision oncology project. As we engage with new data types, our aim is to develop high-quality computational and statistical methods of wide applicability. We consider the release and maintenance of scientific software an integral part of scientific publishing, and we contribute to the\xa0Bioconductor Project,\xa0an open source software collaboration to provide tools for the analysis and study of high-throughput genomic data. An example is our DESeq2 package for analysing count data from high-throughput sequencing. We aim to develop the computational techniques needed to analyse exciting biological data types: \n\n Figure 2: Ternary plots of relative sensitivities to targeted kinase inhibitors for a cohort of primary tumour samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).

### Eileen Furlong
 Figure 1: Enhancers interact with genes over very long distances within the Drosophila genome, as shown by 4C-Seq (top) and DNA FISH (bottom) during embryogenesis (Ghavi-Helm Y, et al., Nature 2014).  Figure 2: Chromatin state and Pol II occupancy on enhancers (yellow) is highly predictive of enhancers\u2019 activity, with Pol II being predictive for the precise timing during development (Bonn*, Zinzen*, Girardot*, et al., Nature Genetics 2012). The Furlong group dissects fundamental principles of transcriptional regulation, and how that drives cell fate decisions during development, focusing on organisational and functional properties of the genome. Precise regulation of gene expression is essential for almost all biological processes, and a key driving force in development, evolution and disease. Expression states are initiated through diverse cues modulating transcription factor activity, which converge on cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers. Enhancers thereby act as integration platforms to control specific patterns of expression, telling genes when and where to be expressed. Given their central role, mutations in enhancers often lead to devastating developmental defects and are becoming increasingly linked to human disease Our research focuses on dissecting general mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, including how the cis-regulatory genome is organised within the nucleus (Figure 1), and how chromatin state and transcription factor occupancy influence this process (Figure 2).\xa0 We investigate how natural sequence variation (both within and between species) affects transcription, leading to specific phenotypes.\xa0 Our work combines genomic, genetic and computational approaches to understand these processes, including the development of new genomic tools to facilitate this analysis within the context of a multi-cellular embryo; Drosophila mesoderm specification. How our huge genome is packaged within the confined space of the nucleus to facilitate transcription remains a key challenge in genome regulation. For enhancers to function, they must come in proximity to their target genes. We recently discovered a surprising stability of these \u2018looping\u2019 interactions during two stages of embryonic development (Nature 2014). Going forward, we will examine this over an extensive developmental time-course, integrating high-resolution imaging and genetics to dissect the relationship between proximity and transcriptional regulation. To uncover general properties of enhancer function we developed a method to investigate cell type-specific changes in chromatin state in the context of a multicellular embryo\u2019s development (Figure 2; Nature Genetics 2012). Going forward, we will combine this technology with single cell methods and CRISPR/Cas9 technology to understand regulatory properties associated with developmental transitions. Variation in the non-coding genome is widely associated with Quantitative Trait Loci and GWAS loci. Many of these disease-associated variants are in cis-regulatory elements, yet it is very difficult to pinpoint the causal SNP within the human genome and therefore dissect the underlying mechanism. We are developing methods to bridge this gap, taking advantage of the extremely high sequence variation among wild Drosophila isolates, to dissect functional regulatory variants involved in transcription and genome organisation during embryonic development.

### Marcus Heisler
 Confocal projection showing polar localisation of the auxin efflux carrier PIN1 fused to GFP. At organ inception PIN1 polarities are directed away from adjacent organ sites and towards the new site. \xa0 Using A. thaliana as a model, the Heisler group seeks to understand patterning in plant development and how it is established and regulated. In addition to providing us with the air we breathe, the food we eat and much of the energy and materials we use, plants exhibit a unique beauty associated with their strikingly symmetrical patterns of development. Multicellularity also evolved independently in plants giving us an opportunity to compare and contrast the developmental strategies used in different kingdoms. Lateral organ formation in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana provides an ideal system for investigating plant development since it involves the coordination of several fundamental processes, including cell polarity, gene expression and morphogenesis. Our previous work reveals that patterns of cell polarity control both morphogenesis at the cellular level as well as at the tissue level. This integration occurs through the co-alignment of microtubule arrays with the polar localisation patterns of the auxin efflux carrier PIN1. The microtubule cytoskeleton regulates growth direction at the cellular level, while PIN1 works to concentrate the hormone auxin at the tissue level to localise growth. Our data so far suggests a role for mechanical stresses in orienting these factors and we are further investigating this possibility. More recently we have found that organogenesis correlates spatially with a boundary between the expression domains of genes normally associated with the top (dorsal) and bottom (ventral) tissues of leaves. In fact, we have found that juxtaposition of dorsal and ventral gene expression domains is necessary for leaves to initiate properly and the creation of new dorsoventral gene expression boundaries provokes the formation of new leaf tissues along the boundary. Similar juxtaposition dependent development occurs in response to the formation of dorsoventral boundaries during insect wing and vertebrate limb development suggesting a similar logic operates in these otherwise very different contexts. Our current and future research focuses on the establishment and function of dorsoventral boundaries in plants. Our main questions include: How do dorsoventral gene expression boundaries regulate organ morphogenesis and positioning, for example cell polarity patterns? And how are dorsoventral gene expression boundaries established and regulated?  Find out more about the European Research Council

### Anne-Claude Gavin
\xa0 The group studies diverse organisms: the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Chaetomium thermophilum (thermophilic eukaryote), the human pathogen Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and human somatic stem cells (MMPU group and EU-funded SyStemAge), with datasets contributing detailed cartographies of biological processes relevant to human health or disease. Another major goal is the generation of organism-wide, systematic datasets of protein-metabolite regulatory circuits, and hypotheses or models concerning the consequences of dysfunction in human diseases. The Gavin group focuses on detailed and systematic charting of cellular networks and circuitry at molecular levels in time and space. Models of biological systems are expected to be predictive of different healthy and pathological conditions and to provide the general principles for the (re)engineering of biological systems. Our group has pioneered biochemical methods, coupled to quantitative mass-spectrometry, to systematically link dynamic protein interaction networks to various phenotypes in model organisms, human cells and human pathogens. On the long term, we aim to advance network biology and medicine through the integration of quantitative biochemistry, proteomics and structural biology, and define system-wide hypotheses explaining complex phenotypes and human diseases. We will contribute new strategies for the targeting of human pathologies and provide insight into fundamental principles and rules guiding biomolecular recognition. Charting biological networks: The organisation of biological systems in dynamic, functional assemblies with varying levels of complexity remains largely elusive. One of our main focuses is on deciphering the molecular mechanisms of cell function or dysfunction, which relies to a large extent on tracing the multitude of physical interactions between the cell\u2019s many components. We apply a range of biochemical and quantitative mass spectrometry approaches to organisms including yeast, a human pathogen and human somatic stem cells. We aim to identify drug targets and understand the mechanisms and side-effects of therapeutic compounds. Incorporation of structural models, single-particle electron microscopy, and cellular electron tomograms (in collaboration with structural groups at EMBL) provide supporting details for the proteome organisation. Development of new methods for charting new types of biological networks: While the study of protein-protein and protein-DNA networks currently produce spectacular results, other critically important cellular components \u2013 metabolites \u2013 have rarely been studied via systematic interaction screens. We currently focus on lipids and have developed new technologies with the capacity to produce systematic datasets measuring protein-lipid interactions. We designed miniaturised arrays of artificial membranes on a small footprint, coupled to microfluidic systems. We have also combined protein fractionation and lipidomics to characterise soluble protein-lipid complexes. We aim to extend the analyses to the entire proteome and lipidome and develop more generic approaches measuring all protein-metabolite interactions. Chemistry at EMBL

 Figure 1: On adherent cultured cells, CLEM relies on coordinates that are visible by both light and electron microscopy. Precise targeting enables the acquisition of selected subcellular volumes with a FIB-SEM.  Figure 2: On multicellular specimens (here, mouse brain), our targeting methods enable studying identified cells (tumour cells) by multimodal correlative microscopy (intravital microscopy, microCT and FIB-SEM; from Karreman et al. 2016). The Schwab team is interested in developing tools for the 3D correlation of data generated by fluorescent imaging and by electron microscopy. Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) is a set of techniques that allow data acquisition with both imaging modalities on a single object. It is a growing field that now includes a large variety of strategies, and one that reaches a high degree of precision, even in complex biological models. Before joining EMBL, we were developing tools and protocols to track rare objects or dynamic phenomena on cultured cells and bulk specimen such as nematodes and murine tissues. One common challenge when trying to combine imaging modalities on the same sample is to identify space cues (external or internal) to track single objects when switching from light microscopy (LM) to electron microscopy (EM). On adherent cultured cells, we have previously developed specific substrates with coordinates to precisely record the position of cells (Spiegelhalter et al., 2009). Currently, we are exploiting these approaches to develop new workflows allowing the study of a higher number of cells. On more complex specimens, such as multicellular organisms, this targeting is even more critical, as systematic EM acquisition of their entire volume is close to impossible. For this reason, we are developing new methods to map the region of interest (ROI) within large living specimens, taking advantage of structural hallmarks in the sample that are visible with both LM and EM. The position of the ROI is mapped in 3D by confocal or multiphoton microscopy and then tracked at the EM level by targeted ultramicrotomy (Kolotuev et al. 2009; 2012; Goetz et al. 2014). Relying on structural features of the sample as anchor points, the cell or structure of interest can then be retrieved with sub-micrometric precision (Durdu et al. 2014, Karreman et al. 2014, 2015). In parallel to the fast evolution of CLEM techniques over the past decade, acquisition methods in electron microscopes have significantly evolved with special breakthroughs in the volume analysis of cells by TEM tomography and automated serial imaging in scanning electron microscopy (ASI-SEM). Our team, in collaboration with other scientists and our industrial partners, combines these advanced techniques to perform CLEM in the 3D space on complex model specimens for cell and developmental biology. We aim to develop new techniques and software to facilitate and automate the correlation and acquisition of large amounts and volumes of sample. By automating these tedious procedures, we intend to improve the throughput of data collection.
